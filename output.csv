Geopolitics of the Digital Economy: Implications for States and Firms,"Lawton, Thomas C. ;  Tonn Goulart Moura, Stephanie ;  Tobin, Damian ;  Silva-Rêgo, Bernardo",,"AIB insights, 2023","The lack of boundaries in cyberspace contributes to geopolitical disputes, as data and technology are weaponized across borders, and hacking of critical infrastructure becomes pervasive. But we lack a framework for understanding the tangible impact of geopolitical tensions and digital proxy conflict on states and firms. We argue that governments and companies can gain insights into these tensions by examining who controls the main structural power pillars of the international political economy: production, security, knowledge, and finance. Based on this approach, we consider how policymakers and practitioners can engage and navigate digital geopolitics in an age of uncertainty."
Media in the Geopolitical Crossfire: Identification and Novel Data Sources for IB Research,"Puhr, Harald ;  Kupfer, Alexander",,"AIB insights, 2023","The media is a rich data source for IB scholars to study policy uncertainty, stakeholder attention, and issue salience. However, the media is exposed to geopolitical tension and political interference. The resulting bias distorts the insights scholars gain from media analysis and leads to potentially impaired conclusions. This study introduces GDELT and Google Trends as novel data sources to handle this challenge. Their usefulness is illustrated by an analysis of media coverage of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine in 2022. The paper guides scholars in conducting media-based research in the face of abrupt geopolitical tension and political interference."
Assessing Geopolitical Risk: A Multi-Level Approach for Top Managers of Multinationals,"De Villa, Maria A.",,"AIB insights, 2023","Geopolitical risk is a major concern for top managers of multinationals around the globe. However, top managers often find it challenging to assess how geopolitical risk can impact their multinational’s operations. Hence, this article offers top managers a multi-level approach for the holistic assessment of geopolitical risk that can help them identify their multinational’s degree of exposure. This multi-level approach integrates insights of over one hundred top managers of multinationals, and involves conducting a tailored examination at the supranational, international, national, industry, and firm levels of analysis to factor geopolitical risk more effectively into strategic decision making."

"Managing, Structuring and Scaling Innovation in International Organizations","Tatarinov, Katherine",,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (4)","This article summarizes my award-winning dissertation on innovation for transforming the United Nations (UN) to solve the grand challenges in a technologically evolving world. It answers: how do the processes of managing, structuring and scaling innovation impact international organizations and the fulfilment of their missions? Findings show that innovative initiatives lead to the development of responsible innovation capacity, that scaling digital solutions for wicked problems requires global/local ecosystem actors to take on new roles in each location, and that innovation units create value through relationships not owned by one party. These contributions exhibit the cross-sectoral potential for delivering global impact through innovation. It also shows that IB scholars have the frameworks and tools to move beyond traditional contexts to address real problems in the global economy."
Iterate to Innovate: How Firms Strategize Design Iteration to Navigate the Uneven Landscape in the Global Mobile Application Industry,"Zhang, Pengxiang",Competitive advantage ;  Computer & video games ;  Datasets ;  Dissertations & theses ;  Entrepreneurs ;  Innovations ;  Investigations ;  Market positioning ;  Mobile communications networks ;  Product design ;  Research design ;  Social networks ;  Social research,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (4), p.1-5","Digital firms constantly iterate products to capture innovation opportunities. As digitalization transforms the global marketplace, firms all over the world must strategize iteration across various institutional contexts. My dissertation starts by establishing that firms need to be cautious about introducing iteration given its demand-side costs. Further, I find that frequent iterations enable digital firms to become innovative in uncertain institutional environments compared to stable environments. Moreover, iterating with regular rhythms help firms diversify across platform markets, but not so if firms diversify across heterogeneous country markets. Hence, both institutional conditions and market diversification must be considered when strategizing iteration."
General Manager Succession in Multinational Enterprise Subsidiaries,"Li, Liang (Arthur)",Appointments & personnel changes ;  Decision making ;  Dissertations & theses ;  Foreign subsidiaries ;  Host country ;  Hypothesis testing ;  Managers ;  Multinational corporations ;  Power ;  Workforce planning,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (4), p.1-5","This dissertation, based on interviews with over 40 managers and quantitative data on over 1,900 foreign subsidiaries, aims to provide new insights regarding subsidiary general manager (GM) changes in multinational enterprises (MNEs). I study continual GM change, individual succession event, the decision-making process through which different types of subsidiary GM successors are selected, and how they link to subsidiary performance. I found that GM succession decisions are path dependent and evolving, can be influenced by MNE environments, and need to be based on both GM successor nationality and origin. My dissertation underscores the complexity of subsidiary GM succession and bridges succession strategy with implementation."

Knowledge Management Mechanisms at MNCs and the Enhancing Effect of Absorptive Capacity,"Barakat, Livia Lopes",Absorptive capacity ;  Cultural differences ;  Emerging markets ;  Foreign subsidiaries ;  Innovations ;  Knowledge management ;  Knowledge sharing ;  R&D ;  Research & development ;  Socialization ;  Teams,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (4), p.1-5","Knowledge management has a pivotal role in innovation processes and on firms’ competitiveness. In order to generate innovations, firms may access knowledge from different sources, including their internal and external environments. However, to fully assimilate such knowledge and apply it to commercial ends, firms need absorptive capacity (AC). AC is particularly important for multinational corporations (MNCs), as they face several learning challenges arising from increased global competition as well as geographic, institutional, and cultural differences. With this in mind, my dissertation explores the relationship between knowledge management mechanisms and innovation and performance outcomes as well as the enabling role of absorptive capacity in such relationships. The findings show that MNC managers can use different mechanisms for souring, transferring, and applying knowledge, which increase the firm´s ability to absorb knowledge and, in turn, lead to product and/or process innovation."
Building Bridges Between (Global) Business and the Rainbow Community in India: An Interview with Pride Circle’s Co-founder Ramkrishna Sinha,"Rašković, Matevž (Matt) ;  Sinha, Ramkrishna (Ram)",Annual reports ;  Competitive advantage ;  Customer services ;  Emerging markets,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (3), p.1-5","As long as business is done, there also has to be a business case for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), says Ram Sinha from the Pride Circle. When it comes to DEI activities, the often invisible nature of the LGBT+ community, its smaller size (relative to other minorities) and vast heterogeneity, as well as lack of standardization of basic terminology, make building bridges between MNEs and the community quite challenging. In this interview with one of Asia’s leading social enterprises in the LGBT+ space, Ram shares his vast experience in the rapidly evolving DEI landscape. He also provides actionable insights for IB scholars, practitioners, educators and policymakers on MNE operations in an emerging market which is quickly becoming a hotbed of DEI innovation."
"Neurodiversity, Equity, and Inclusion in MNCs","Ott, Dana L ;  Russo, Emily ;  Moeller, Miriam",Autism ;  Employees ;  Employment ;  Human resource management ;  International organizations ;  Multiculturalism & pluralism ;  Multinational corporations ;  Neurodiversity ;  Workplace diversity,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (3), p.1-5","Neurodiversity is likely present as an 'invisible' inequality in most, if not all, multinational corporations (MNCs). The unique characteristics and cultural sensitivities of global operating environments challenge MNCs' efforts to promote awareness and embed neurodiversity into their cross-border diversity, equity, and inclusion agendas. Drawing from both practitioner and academic sources, we speak to MNCs and their international human resource management leaders by providing concrete guidance for navigating the fostering and advancing of their neurodiversity initiatives, notwithstanding the operating environment. Through our proposed initiatives the strengths and perspectives of neurodivergent employees can be successfully harnessed, leading to improved effectiveness and performance for MNCs."
Born as a Citizen and Reborn as an Alien: Migrant Superdiversity in Global Business,"Kothari, Tanvi ;  Elo, Maria ;  Wiese, Nila",Brain research ;  Citizenship ;  Coronaviruses ;  COVID-19 ;  Diaspora ;  Economic growth ;  Entrepreneurs ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Gender ;  Globalization ;  Host country ;  Immigration ;  Industrialized nations ;  Intersectionality ;  Language ;  Migration ;  Minority & ethnic groups ;  Multiculturalism & pluralism ;  Multilingualism ;  Noncitizens ;  Pandemics ;  Sexual orientation,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (3), p.1-6","The racial, ethnic and other compositions of modern societies have fundamentally changed in the last few decades as a consequence of mass migration. Migration has generated superdiversity. This paper attempts to illuminate the area ‘Migration and Diversity’ through a discussion of migration that reviews and incorporates various lenses of diversity. We shed light on managerial and policy areas that need attention to enhance firms’ competitiveness and the social cohesion of migrants that are treated as ‘aliens’ as they transition across borders. We seek to alert readers to the urgency and salience of migrant superdiversity as an emergent topic, especially from an equity and inclusion lens."
Diversity in Global Mining: Where We Are and What We Need to Do,"Sasikala, Visalakshy ;  Sankaranarayanan, Venkataraman",Accountability ;  Disability ;  Employment ;  Equality ;  Ethnicity ;  Executives ;  Gender equity ;  Mining industry ;  Multiculturalism & pluralism ;  Native peoples ;  Sexual orientation ;  Sustainability reporting ;  Workplace diversity,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (3), p.1-8","We explore how diversity plays out in a historically male-dominated domain of international business – mining – by analyzing the diversity statements and initiatives reported by 25 of the top 50 global mining firms in terms of market value. We find that home country organizational field configurations play a pivotal role in determining how mining firms perceive diversity and the specific diversity dimensions they focus on. We distinguish between accommodative, defensive and reactive configurations to understand regional variation in the way mining firms manage diversity. We provide actionable recommendations to key stakeholders on adopting a proactive approach towards advancing diversity."

It then overviews the issue's seven articles and one practitioner interview, which address broader DEI issues such as refugees and migration and the influence of the institutional environment, as well as specific DEI dimensions related to gender, differently abledness and LGBT+ inclusion."
"How Multinational Corporations Can Support Refugee Workforce Integration: Empathize Globally, Strategize Locally","Szkudlarek, Betina ;  Roy, Priya ;  Lee, Eun Su",Employers ;  Employment ;  Immigration ;  Localization ;  Multinational corporations ;  Refugees ;  Workforce,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (3), p.1-5","In the global war for talent, refugees are often overlooked. Yet, research indicates that employers who expanded their recruitment strategies to include refugee jobseekers were not only satisfied with their new hires, but also excited about the potential impact refugee recruitment could have on their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) strategies. We use the case of IKEA to show how localization and global strategy interact to create sustainable refugee workforce integration solutions for multinational corporations. Our insights have practical implications for other industry leaders who aim to create their own refugee inclusion programs."
It Is All in Their Positioning: Academic Women’s Silence in Iran,"Lotfi Dehkharghani, Leila ;  Menzies, Jane ;  Suri, Harsh ;  Maharati, Yaghoob",Culture ;  Economic summit conferences ;  Equal rights ;  Gender equity ;  Inequality ;  International organizations ;  Interviews ;  Islam ;  Muslims ;  Parity ;  Society ;  Women ;  Workforce,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (3), p.1-6","From a gender perspective, Iran is an unequal country, ranking 150 out of 156 in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Survey. We examine women's silence in an academic setting in Iran using positioning theory to understand discursive practices that contribute to women's silence. We argue that women's silence in Iran is regularly reinforced with storylines that impact upon, and constrain, women's sense of self on an interpersonal and individual level. These storylines emanate from the macro, meso and organizational environments. We provide recommendations to local and international organizations operating in Iran that are conducive for creating new storylines to reduce women's silence."
Transcending Cheap Talk in Female Entrepreneurship: Cross-Country Evidence,"Chakraborty, Suparna ;  Chopra, Ryka C.",Empowerment ;  Entrepreneurial finance ;  Entrepreneurs ;  Political representation,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (3), p.1-5","Encouraging entrepreneurship is an effective way to empower women. While most nations have policies empowering women, are these policies effective in encouraging female entrepreneurship? Additionally, is there a gap between policy enactment and enforcement that hinders entrepreneurship? In this short article, we start a conversation by examining cross-country differences in female entrepreneurship and relating them to existing social, educational, and workplace policies. Further, we suggest a novel measure of enforcement that effectively captures the divergence between stated policies and successful reduction of discriminatory practices on the ground, providing us a tool to isolate cheap talk from effective policy intervention."
Institutional Distance versus Intra-Country Differences: Capturing and Leveraging the Diversity Within,"Perkins, Susan E",Culture ;  Gender ;  Minority & ethnic groups ;  Multiculturalism & pluralism ;  Profitability ;  Social interaction ;  Subcultures ;  Teachers,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (3), p.1-7","The field of international business (IB) largely focuses on the inter-country institutional differences, however, very little focus and attention have been given to the social interactions of sub-cultural groups within the country. Could we be overlooking greater opportunities for understanding differences across the diversity within countries? This article aims to provide insights and practical suggestions on: (1) How does leveraging intra-country diversity affect firm performance outcomes globally? (2) Why understanding intra-country diversity is important to the field of IB? and (3) How can IB scholars, managers, and educators engage further as a discipline to explore strategies that achieve more diverse and equitable societal and economic outcomes?"

Response to Economic Shocks: An Organizational Fit Perspective,"Lahiri, Nandini",,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (2)","The outcome of firm choices is better understood when viewed through a contingency framework. By treating prior organizational choices of geographic and vertical scope as a bundle, I propose that fit drives whether these seemingly independent choices align with each other. The recent shortage in the chip industry provides a context to evaluate whether expansion of fabrication facilities enhance (or diminish) the overall impact of the bundle of choices. Using examples of leading firms in the industry, I help frame an argument that may provide insight into why some firms’ new fabrication location choices may be more optimal than others."

The United Nations (UN) organizations are tasked with solving the world’s pressing and difficult problems. These organizations are major players in international governance and are characterized by bureaucratic, globally dispersed and politically driven structures, but are hardly ever considered in IB research. The UN organizations are struggling to create innovative approaches to fulfil their core missions in today’s digital world and evidence shows that intrapreneurship and scaling innovation will be critical for transformation."

Complexity denotes the systemic nature of the field. We apply this framework to the multinational enterprise and discuss applied insights for various key stakeholders."

MNE Opportunities to Lead Global Sustainable Development through Food Waste Recycling,"Ku, Sarah",,"AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (1)","Food waste is a global problem. When discarded into landfills through traditional municipal solid waste disposal, food waste is costly, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and highlights disparities of food insecurity. Government and retail campaigns overwhelmingly target consumers as responsible actors for tackling food waste through prevention, reduction, and recovery activities. Multinational enterprises (MNEs), however, play significant roles in contributing to global food waste and therefore must also face responsibility for contributing to sustainable solutions. The organizational management of food waste through recycling strategies confronts multiple United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) with economic, environmental, and social implications."

On the pro side, the SDGs are comprehensive and actionable. On the con side, they are vague, complex and may lend themselves to “rainbow-washing.” We provide suggestions for managers to help them respond to these challenges by avoiding cherry-picking SDGs, using the SDGs to assess sustainability, and pursuing SDG projects via partnerships."

It is also envisaged that collaborative efforts of governments, society, and MNEs are necessary to achieve these goals. The impact of new realities, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, is discussed. Many companies are now claiming to pursue these goals. We call for more research to analyze these activities to separate rhetoric from the reality."

The organizational management of food waste through recycling strategies confronts multiple United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) with economic, environmental, and social implications."

They are often brought about by ‘social activists’ from within or connected to the firm. Drawing on in-depth research in MNCs, we identify two key practices and three types of skills used by social activists to drive these initiatives, enabling them to build stakeholder relationships and generate organizational buy-in. We offer a series of actionable insights that allow MNCs to better support social activists within and beyond the organization, thus enhancing social innovation activity."
Essays in Comparative International Entrepreneurship Research,"Kleinhempel, Johannes",Culture ;  Dissertations & theses ;  Entrepreneurs ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Immigrants ;  Influence ;  Self employment ;  Social capital,"AIB insights, 2021, Vol.21 (4), p.1-7","Entrepreneurship does not take place in a vacuum but is deeply embedded in its context. This dissertation proposes three new perspectives which highlight (1) the changing impact of socio-cultural conditions over the course of the venture creation process, (2) the persistence, portability, and intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurial culture, and (3) the different theoretical channels through which culture influences entrepreneurship. This dissertation advances three fresh perspectives which shed new light on the critical role of socio-cultural influences in comparative international entrepreneurship research."

Conflict and Order in the Global Project Organization,"Pacheco, Rachel",,"AIB insights, 2021, Vol.21 (4)","The global project organization is a group of firms that comes together to complete a goal, such as the building of a bridge, the construction of a power plant, or the development of a new technology. These project organizations are complex as multiple firms with different operating norms, backgrounds, and organizational cultures coordinate and collaborate to avoid harmful conflict. Additionally, these project organizations navigate complex external environments as governments, local labor groups, and other stakeholders are often involved and impacted by project organization’s operations. In this research, I examine how the structure of the project organization, specifically how the concentration of power affects conflict and ultimately performance."

I employ multi-level data on U.S. antitrust enforcement (industry-level), inward-FDI (industry-level), cross-border M&As (firm-level), and Greenfield FDI (firm-level) in the U.S. markets over 2002–2017 for empirical testing. The findings support my theoretical priors that U.S. antitrust enforcement increases after the global financial crisis, deters aggregated inward-FDI and foreign-acquirer-presence in local M&A markets, and attracts Greenfield FDI."

Organizational Reputation for Customers: Key Insights on Leveraging Reputation in Global Markets,"Agarwal, James ;  Osiyevskyy, Oleksiy",,"AIB insights, 2021, Vol.21 (3)","Organizational reputation is a strategic asset leading to numerous firm-level benefits. Yet, the translation of favorable reputation into valuable organizational outcomes in global markets depends on whether national (vs. individual) culture is modeled. We provide a framework of customer-based ‘organizational reputation’ comprising three distinct reputational facets: product & service efficacy, market prominence, and societal ethicality, with organizational character forming a higher-order ‘halo effect’. Individual (vs. national) culture plays a significant moderating role in translating reputation into customer-specific outcomes and these insights have implications on how MNEs can form and leverage their reputation in global markets."
Creating Shared Reputational Value while Managing Informational Asymmetries across Borders: The Platform Business Paradox,"Kelley, Keith ;  Thams, Yannick",,"AIB insights, 2021, Vol.21 (3)","This article explores the interplay between the platform business model and the creation and distribution of shared reputational value. Broadly speaking, platform businesses serve to connect consumers with producers and often rely on a global network to create value. A paradox exists in that while platform economies should reduce informational asymmetries through signaling, the attribution of signals for reputational outcomes is imprecise when so much value creation is shared. This article helps practitioners understand the creation of shared reputational value with respect to the platform business model and employs the CAGE framework to highlight challenges of operating across national borders."

Global Pandemics and the Economics of Value Chains: COVID-19 and the Production of Medical Devices,"Nachum, Lilac",,"AIB insights, 2021, Vol.21 (2)","Pandemics change the dynamics of value chains in fundamental ways, and particularly of those producing the medical devices needed to fight them. This paper shows that the rationale for organization of the production of these devices differs from that of most other products. Varying trade-offs between the benefits of global integration and the imperatives of secured and speedy supply favor different production modes. Value chains of different geographic scales – local, regional and global – are suitable for different medical devices. A model developed based on these variations could assist policymakers in designing differentiated policies towards different medical devices. As well, the model provides insights that could aid supply chain managers and academics rethinking the determinants of supply chain structures across industries."

[...]cost of production, a major driver of globallyintegrated production, is of lesser importance in relation to medical devices, notably during times of pandemics. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, fragmented sources of supplies connected to each other via trade were abruptly interrupted by logistic difficulties as factories confronted irregularities of labor and supply, port closures, and customs slowdowns (Perez-Batres & Treviño, 2020).

Multinational enterprises and limits to international growth,"Hendriks, Guus",Bias ;  Dissertations & theses ;  Emerging markets ;  Globalization ;  Multinational corporations ;  Retail stores,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (4), p.1-5","My doctoral research addresses the limits to international growth that multinational enterprises (MNEs) face, with a particular focus on the role of the home country within a portfolio of international activities. The importance of that market, in combination with several types of home-country uncertainties, may limit the attention devoted by MNE managers to internationalization, evidenced by lower added cultural distance. Similarly, the net growth of an MNE’s country portfolio may be limited by cultural and economic diversity within that portfolio, but it also hinges on how well the MNE is performing relative to its aspirations. In an emerging market context, an ‘upgrading paradox’ seems to apply, as firms face important recombination barriers to growth."

Buckley and Mark Casson AIB Dissertation Award and AIB Presidential Recognition Award,"Mezias, John ;  Newburry, William; John Mezias",Awards & honors ;  Dissertations & theses ;  Foreign subsidiaries ;  Globalization ;  Leadership ;  Multinational corporations,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (4), p.1-2","Since 2013, AIB Insights has dedicated an issue to finalists for the prestigious Peter J. Buckley and Mark Casson AIB Dissertation Award. For the eighth consecutive year, we proudly feature articles by the four award finalists summarizing insights from their cutting-edge dissertation research. Converting to digital distribution allows us to essentially publish a double issue by also presenting a Topic Forum on this year’s AIB Presidential Recognition Award. This award honored the 30th anniversary of the World Investment Report (WIR) and its contribution to the field of international business. We include commentaries by the three leaders of the WIR report across its 30 issues, and two articles detailing the scope and impact of these reports."
UN and Business: The WIR Prequel,"Miroux, Anne",Developing countries ;  Foreign investment ;  Geopolitics ;  International relations ;  LDCs ;  Multinational corporations ;  R&D ;  Research & development ;  Transnationalism ;  Trends,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (4), p.1-3","Referring back to the genesis of the
World Investment Report
(
WIR
), this article shows how the
WIR
fits into a key objective of the UN’s business agenda: enhancing the contribution of multinational enterprises to economic growth and development. Focusing on a particular period of the
WIR
life (the second half of the 2000s), this article highlights how the Report contributed to that end through the topics selected, the involvement of local stakeholders in the production process, and academic collaboration. While building on sound analytical bases, the Report provided action-oriented policy recommendations for effective and positive changes on the ground."
Nonmarket Strategies across Complex Institutional Contexts,"Klopf, Patricia",Corruption ;  Influence ;  Knowledge ;  Lobbying ;  Multinational corporations ;  Regulation ;  Stakeholders ;  Subsidiaries,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (4), p.1-4","Managers face nonmarket pressures that increasingly challenge the way they run their firms. These challenges often require managers to get savvy in nonmarket strategy. While nonmarket strategy can be relevant for all firms, it is particularly relevant for multinational enterprise subsidiaries, because they operate in countries that differ from their multinational enterprise’s home country and are thus subject to the liability of foreignness. In my dissertation research, I was aiming to better understand the incentives and drivers behind firms’ nonmarket strategies."
The WIR at 30: Contributions to National and Global Investment Policymaking,"Sauvant, Karl P.",Developing countries ;  Foreign investment ;  LDCs ;  Multinational corporations ;  Transfer pricing,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (4), p.1-6","UNCTAD’s
World Investment Report
(
WIR
) focusses on development-oriented questions related to the interaction between multinational enterprises (MNEs) and governments. It does that with a view toward developing policy recommendations to maximize the positive impact of foreign direct investment and MNE activities on host countries and minimize any negative impacts. This article examines the reason for this focus and approach, as well as a number of related issues, and evaluates how successful UNCTAD has been in pursuing it."

What next? Whither WIR?
I argue that upcoming
WIR
s should address a mix of Big Questions and Grand Challenges and provide a baker’s dozen list of 13 possible themes."
Introduction: WIR at 30 Topic Forum and AIB Presidential Recognition Award,"Clegg, Jeremy",Awards & honors ;  Foreign investment ;  Transnationalism,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (4), p.1-2",In this article I introduce AIB Insights’ topic forum on the World Investment Report at 30 and the special award session at the Academy of International Business 2020 Annual Meeting that inspired these ensuing articles.
Taming COVID-19 through Social Resilience: A Meta-Capability Policy Framework from Australia and New Zealand,"Menzies, Jane ;  Raskovic, Matevz (Matt)",,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (3)","As a wicked problem, COVID-19 creates unique policy challenges which can be tamed through a meta-capability social resilience approach. Drawing on experience from Australia and New Zealand, we propose a meta-capability social resilience framework to inform policymakers. The framework examines the mobilization of various resources and the employment of specific capabilities across four stages of disruption."
Exploring the Liability of Origin: Lessons from Smithfield Foods and Meat Processing in the US During COVID-19,"Shapiro, Daniel M. ;  Li, Jing ;  Feng, Cai Mitsu",,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (3)","The Liability of Origin (LOR) refers to disadvantages faced abroad by firms sharing common national origins. We examine the country of origin effect on Smithfield Foods (owned by a Chinese parent), one of the largest meat companies in the US, before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. We find evidence that Smithfield experienced legitimacy challenges associated with its Chinese ownership. We conclude that animosity between a multinational enterprise’s home and host countries is an important source of LOR and discuss three strategies (distancing and localization, stakeholder, and social media) that might help companies overcome these challenges."
Letter from the Editors: Special Issue on “Effects of Coronavirus on International Business”,"Mezias, John ;  Newburry, William; John Mezias",Black swan event ;  Clinical trials ;  Coronaviruses ;  COVID-19 vaccines ;  International ;  Pandemics ;  Supply chains,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (3), p.1-2","In this article, AIB Insights’ editors introduce their Special Issue focusing on effects of COVID-19 on international business policies and strategies. The seven articles published in this issue provide key insights for navigating international business during this pandemic."
"Reappraising International Business in a Digital Arena: Barriers, Strategies, and Context for Digital Internationalization","Shaheer, Noman Ahmed",Business models ;  Competition ;  Economic development ;  Globalization ;  Innovations ;  Market entry ;  Social networks ;  Streaming media ;  Streaming services ;  Technological change,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (4), p.1-5","Born-digital firms face a new set of internationalization challenges. Despite their digital innovations being globally available, born-digital firms still need to satisfy diverse user preferences across countries and stand out against stiff competition to internationalize their digital innovations. Born-digital firms may overcome these challenges by strategically leveraging their users. In particular, acquiring users in certain lead markets can enable born-digital firms to spread global word-of-mouth or upgrade their digital innovations to appeal to users in multiple countries. Hence, born-digital firms should first expand to lead countries that could serve as springboards for global diffusion of their digital innovations."
COVID-19 and the Dynamics of Distance in International Business,"Côté, Christine ;  Estrin, Saul ;  Meyer, Klaus E. ;  Shapiro, Daniel",Coronaviruses ;  COVID-19 ;  Education ;  International ;  Pandemics ;  Public health ;  Subsidiaries ;  Trends,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (3), p.1-5","Distance is a central concept in the teaching of international business (IB). However, most textbooks treat distance as static or slowly changing. We argue that distance is inherently a dynamic construct, as highlighted by the impact of COVID-19 on international business activities. Using the popular CAGE framework as a baseline, we illustrate the implications of distance being dynamic by introducing likely effects of COVID-19 on distance, and by discussing in depth barriers to the movement of people as an important aspect of distance. We conclude with implications for the application of distance in corporate decision making and international business teaching."
In an Era of Disruption: Multinationals’ Responses to Host Country Political Violence,"Liu, Chang",Decision making ;  Executives ;  Host country ;  Multinational corporations ;  Terrorism,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (4), p.1-4","This dissertation investigates how multinational enterprises (MNEs) respond to host country political violence (specifically, terrorist attacks), and how factors influencing top management teams’ (TMTs) decision making subsequently impact MNEs’ responses. Across three essays, I found that MNEs’ divestments, their likelihood of temporary vs. permanent divestment, and their likelihood of exerting information control in response to host country terrorist attacks are contingent upon executives’ social proximity to the event host countries, CEO conservatism, and TMT gender diversity. This dissertation contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of managerial interpretation in MNEs’ responses to host country political violence."
COVID-19 and International Diversification: A New Paradigm for Multinationals,"DeGhetto, Kaitlyn",,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (3)","COVID-19 has challenged longstanding assumptions about multinationals’ international diversification strategies. Unlike corruption or war, this new type of uncertainty is unavoidable. All countries are affected. And, throughout the pandemic, having a global workforce has created additional challenges related to managing diverse policies, resources, and cultures. Going forward, executives of multinationals will first and foremost consider business continuity when selecting investment locations. Multinationals, especially those in service-based industries, likely will scale down their global operations and focus on countries with infrastructures that support remote work and sustaining healthy populations. Key insights come from an executive who managed his firm’s COVID-19 response."
Global Supply Chains in Response to COVID-19: Adopting a Real Options Mindset,"Perez-Batres, Luis A. ;  Treviño, Len J.",Black swan event ;  Boundaries ;  Coronaviruses ;  Costs ;  COVID-19 ;  Economic crisis ;  Hedging ;  International finance ;  Opportunity costs ;  Pandemics ;  Suppliers ;  Supply chains,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (3), p.1-5","Businesses and governments may have been overconfident in their ability to react efficiently to black swan consequences. COVID-19 levied unforeseen isolation and border closings threatening the survival of global supply chains and the bankruptcy of governments and organizations alike. As a response to this challenge, our proposal takes a real options approach to mitigate supply chain disruptions by developing regional partnerships outside of densely populated areas. Its inherent novelty is twofold: (1) it anticipates survival uncertainties by securing the continued production of goods and services worldwide and (2) it recognizes a change in the relationship’s dynamic between global and regional actors."
New Opportunities and Cautionary Insights about Decentralizing and Deglobalizing Clinical Trials During the Great Lockdown,"Dunlap, Denise ;  Santos, Roberto S ;  McManus, David D ;  Buchholz, Bryan O ;  Hafer, Nathaniel S ;  Picard, MaryAnn",Clinical trials ;  Coronaviruses ;  COVID-19 ;  Decentralization ;  deglobalization ;  Drugs ;  emerging technologies ;  healthcare ;  Interviews ;  Pandemics ;  Patients ;  Regulatory agencies ;  Startups ;  Telemedicine ;  Trends,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (3), p.1-6","The 2020s began with a rare coronavirus (COVID-19) disaster, which led to a pandemic-induced recession and Great Lockdown. In response, there has been a worldwide mobilization of resources to detect, treat, and cure the virus. Some policymakers are advocating for the repatriation of globally distributed healthcare know-how. Without a cure for COVID-19, the ambiguity concerning how coronavirus-related policies will impact international business remains unclear. Through a multi-method approach, our study sheds light on two key healthcare industry trends: decentralization and deglobalization of clinical trials. We offer actionable strategies to not only mitigate these challenges, but also to take advantage of their new opportunities."
Rethinking Overseas Production: The Case of COVID-19‎ and Negative Externality,"Bazel-Shoham, Ofra ;  Shoham, Amir",COVID-19 ;  Exports ;  International trade ;  Manufacturing ;  Medical supplies,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (3), p.1-4","Based on the negative externality argument, we illustrate that international production is a suboptimal solution from the societal perspective of a multinational company’s home country, because moving production abroad can lead to insufficient production in the home country, and excess production abroad. The suboptimal outcome increases with the essentiality of the product. The present argument and results are relevant to policymakers and managers of multinationals, in addition to being useful in the classroom as an additional perspective that shows the complexity of international trade and international production locations."
The WIR@30: Paradigm Shift and a New Research Agenda for the 2020s,"Zhan, James",Economic crisis ;  Foreign investment ;  Global economy ;  International finance ;  Liberalization ;  Manufacturing ;  Multinational corporations ;  Stagnation ;  Supply chains ;  Trends,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (4), p.1-8","This article reviews the evolution of the World Investment Report (WIR) over the past 30 years, with special focus on the period 2010-2020. During this decade, successive WIRs addressed key challenges related to the global shift in the investment-development paradigm. This helped redefine the mainstream policy prescriptions for cross border investment, trade, corporate governance and development. With the global trade and investment landscape expected to be drastically reshaped in the 2020s, this article highlights five mega-forces driving the transformation of global value chains and outlines a fresh multi-disciplinary research agenda for the decade ahead."
Letter from the Editors: Special Issue on “Investigating Modern Slavery: How IB Scholarship Can Contribute”,"Michailova, Snejina ;  Stringer, Christina ;  Mezias, John; John Mezias",Blockchain ;  Ethics ;  Forced labor ;  Human rights ;  International organizations ;  Multinational corporations ;  Slavery ;  Supply chains,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (2), p.1-2",This Special Issue Commentary and Introduction briefly outlines how modern slavery is linked to international business via globally disaggregated production systems governed through ownership and contracts by MNCs. Numerous mechanisms and practices mask the presence of modern slavery across the globe. Uncovering modern slavery is a grand challenge that can and should be tackled by IB researchers and educators. Each of the Special Issue articles is devoted to different aspects of modern slavery and proposes how IB scholarship can address the phenomenon.
(Social) Identity Theory in an Era of Identity Politics: Theory and Practice,"Raskovic, Matevz (Matt)",,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.21 (2)","As a social psychology meta-theory, social identity theory (SIT) continues to evolve and expand in terms of areas of applicability and issues. Revisiting SIT can help IB scholars go beyond applying it to just in-group/out-group behaviour. SIT can also be used to explain collective action, emotion and social change in the face of uncertainty. Managers can use it to address increasing relevance of identity politics, uncertainty and divisiveness. The article overviews the current use of SIT by IB scholars, identifies potential areas of application and provides theoretical and managerial recommendations for the use of SIT."
"Global Citizenship and Business Education, Part 2: The Role of Business Schools","de la Torre, José R. ;  Young, Corinne B.",Business education ;  Citizenship ;  COVID-19 ;  Decision making ;  Ethics ;  MBA programs & graduates ;  Social responsibility,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (1), p.1-6",Over the last decade we have seen increased demands for full stakeholder models in global decision-making and greater emphasis by accrediting agencies that business schools show their commitment to societal ends. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought these issues to the fore. We trace early developments in how business schools dealt with these demands and analyze the data from the Aspen Institute’s survey of business schools’ commitment to global citizenship programs. We then review more recent efforts and report on several institutional and collaborative efforts to promote a global citizenship agenda among business schools and their curricula.
Letter from the Editors: Special Issue on “Responsibilities of Educators in International Business”,"Bird, Allan ;  Panina, Daria ;  Newburry, William",Accountability ;  Business education ;  Citizenship ;  Consortia ;  Cooperation ;  Editors ;  Globalization ;  International ;  Learning ;  Skills ;  Social responsibility ;  Students ;  Teachers ;  Teaching methods ;  Trends,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (1), p.1-3","Working in cooperation with the AIB Teaching and Education Shared Interest Group and the Consortium for Undergraduate International Business Education, this focused issue of AIB Insights seeks to flesh out the contours of responsible IB education and promote a dialogue about enhancing the quality of IB education through an acceptance of greater accountability. The eight articles in the issue help us to better understand the responsibilities of educators in international business, while also proscribing actions we can pursue to achieve this important goal."
Toward Ethical Commitment: Avoiding MNC Entanglement in Modern Slavery,"Van Buren III, H.J ;  Schrempf-Stirling, J ;  Westermann-Behaylo, M",Child labor ;  Cost reduction ;  Ethics ;  Exploitation ;  Forced labor ;  Human rights ;  Injustice ;  Multinational corporations ;  Outsourcing ;  Slavery ;  Standard of living ;  Supply & demand ;  Supply chains,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (2), p.1-4","Multinational corporations are at risk of being connected to modern slavery because of their strategic choices related to outsourcing. The slave labor supply is affected by myriad, localized structural injustices in which weak, ineffective, or corrupt but also well-functioning governments fail to provide for either protection of their constituents against exploitation or for a decent standard of living that would alleviate the human desperation associated with modern slavery. In this article, we highlight three types of responsibility-related reactions to entanglement in modern slavery (implausible deniability, plausible deniability, and ethical commitment) that function as a differentiator between business leaders and laggards."
Can Blockchain Help Resolve Modern Slavery in Supply Chains?,"Boersma, Martijn ;  Nolan, Justine",Blockchain ;  Commodities ;  Digital currencies ;  Exploitation ;  Forced labor ;  Market entry ;  Peer to peer computing ;  Privacy ;  Slavery ;  Suppliers ;  Supply chains ;  Transnationalism ;  Working conditions,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (2), p.1-4","While blockchain was designed as a ledger for cryptocurrency transactions, it can record transactions of anything of value. Blockchain is increasingly used to prove the integrity of commodities, tracing their supply chain journey from the source to the end user. Yet, transferring this technology from a cryptocurrency context to a supply chain setting is not without difficulties. This article explores the implications for multinational and transnational companies in using blockchain as a means to address modern slavery. The research identifies five challenges: verification, inclusion, trust, privacy, and normativity."
Addressing Modern Slavery in the IB Classroom: Are We Doing Enough?,"Nagar, Swati ;  Hurd, Fiona",Business education ;  Classrooms ;  Clothing industry ;  Curricula ;  Ethics ;  Exploitation ;  Forced labor ;  Multinational corporations ;  Pedagogy ;  Slavery ;  Social responsibility ;  Students ;  Teaching methods,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (2), p.1-4","The current literature on modern slavery in IB teaching and research is rather limited. Even in adopting case discussions in the classroom, it is challenging to find resources that highlight an IB context. The challenge, therefore, lies both in the pedagogical motivation to develop teaching strategies and resources as well as undertaking research that helps fill the current literature gap regarding modern slavery. This paper presents a discussion on the importance of developing teaching resources, supported by relevant examples that address modern slavery in the IB classroom."
The Value of International Business Education: How to Achieve Transformative Learning for Students,"Paik, Yongsun",Business education ;  International finance ;  Students ;  Trade disputes,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (1), p.1-5","The slowdown of the global economy exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic provides us an important opportunity to reflect upon the current status and future prospect of international business education. In order to reaffirm the value of international business as a distinct discipline, this article asks the three key questions: Why do we teach international business? What do we teach? How do we teach? International business educators are responsible for preparing students to become future global leaders and citizens through transformative pedagogy that combines the acquisition of knowledge and skills across multidisciplinary disciplines, with meaningful and practical experiences within the subjects they are learning."
Modern Slavery Responses Need International Business Scholarship,"Trautrims, Alexander",Beef ;  Business metrics ;  Business models ;  Debates ;  Human rights ;  International ;  Slavery ;  Social responsibility ;  Suppliers ;  Supply chains ;  Sustainable development,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (2), p.1-4","Modern slavery poses a challenge to many areas of international business and sometimes questions the legitimacy of underlying business models. All businesses are exposed to modern slavery in one way or another through their supply chains, but their actions to address the issue differ hugely. Some blame the complexity and anonymity of international supply chains or the limits of their market power to push for change. These are of course familiar experiences of international business practitioners, but no excuse to avoid action. This article hopes to offer routes and inspiration for international business scholars to contribute to ending modern slavery."
COVID-19 and International Diversifification: A New Paradigm for Multinationals,"DeGhetto, Kaitlyn",Coronaviruses ;  COVID-19 ;  Customer services ;  Diversification ;  Employees ;  Multinational corporations ;  Pandemics ;  Social distancing ;  Social norms ;  Wage rates,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (3), p.1-5","COVID-19 has challenged longstanding assumptions about multinationals' international diversification strategies.

We examine what changes international business (IB) education should consider as these patterns evolve. Non-routine analytical skills and global interpersonal skills will still be important in the changing economy. However, evidence suggests that IB education should also emphasize broader knowledge of politics, institutions, sociology, and anthropology in order to help future business leaders navigate and balance the increasingly complex requirements of both local and global stakeholder interests."
Bringing the Dark Side of International Business into the Classroom,"Cooke, Donna K. ;  DuBois, Frank ;  Sawant, Rajeev J. ;  Sprott, David E. ;  Treviño, Len J.",Automobiles ;  Breweries ;  Case studies ;  Cooperation ;  Corruption ;  Electric vehicles ;  Globalization ;  Human rights ;  Human trafficking ;  Imperialism ;  International ;  Marketing ;  Shareholder meetings ;  Students ;  Teachers ;  Working conditions,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (1), p.1-5",We contend that positioning dark side activities (DSA) as a more central component of IB coursework is important for students to understand the legitimacy and performance consequences of such phenomena. We draw on six types of DSA: environmental degradation; questionable marketing practices; accounting or financial fraud; corruption; labor abuses; and cultural imperialism. We suggest that IB educators expose students to concrete examples illustrating when MNEs may drift to the dark side and provide three short case studies. We provide informational resources and discussion prompts for human trafficking and outline a United Nations framework to structure in-class discussion of DSA.
The Renewed Relevancy of High-Impact Practices (HIP): Doubling Down on our HIP Identity in Support of Responsible IB Education,"Schmidt-King, Astrid",Globalization ;  Higher education ;  Interdisciplinary aspects ;  Internships ;  Learning ;  Pedagogy ;  Portfolios ;  Service learning ;  Skills ;  Students ;  Study abroad ;  Teachers,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (1), p.1-5","While the utilization of High-Impact Practices (HIPs) in higher education is not a new phenomenon, their potential value to international business (IB) education should not be overlooked or underestimated, especially at a time when IB educators need to act strategically and demonstrate the relevancy and value-proposition of IB education in developing global leaders. This article examines the intrinsic value of IB’s interdisciplinary nature and its important relationship with globalization. It then explores two HIPs, e-portfolios and phenomenon-based capstone projects, which are uniquely positioned to enhance and showcase the inherent transformative nature of IB learning and highlight its distinct pedagogical approach."
Preparing Students for the “Next” Global: The Responsibilities and Tools of International Business Education,"Berg, David M.",Business education ;  Citizenship ;  Climate change ;  Critical thinking ;  Experiential learning ;  Industry analysis ;  International ;  Politics ;  Students ;  Study abroad ;  Teachers,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (1), p.1-5","The international business environment is always shifting, now more than ever. One of our main responsibilities and roles as international business educators is to help prepare students to work effectively in a variety of business environments and to provide them with the tools needed to operate in changing global circumstances. Those tools include a global mindset, a sense of global citizenship, and critical thinking skills. This article helps address this need by examining what makes international business education distinctive, then by outlining some exercises and assignments that can be useful in developing those necessary perspectives and skills."
Conceptualizing the Responsible Learning Framework for International Business Faculty Development,"Hruby, Jörg ;  Calixto, Cyntia Vilasboas ;  Mukhi, Umesh",Business schools ;  Classrooms ;  Cognitive style ;  Colleges & universities ;  Educational objectives ;  Learning ;  Pedagogy ;  Students ;  Teachers ;  Teaching,"AIB insights, 2020, Vol.20 (1), p.1-5","Business schools have to deal with complexity and volatility at global and local levels. More concretely, it is the faculty who are at the forefront when it comes to dealing with teaching and research agenda. We bring in a critical perspective about our professional role by recognizing levers and constraints of our sector. We also provide insights on the institutional role by focusing on the nature of responsibility in IB teaching and the factors influencing this responsibility. We believe that this framework could help our fellow faculties to prepare for adaptability and contingency while addressing the needs of society."

Thus, business leaders need to be educated on the skills and values that characterize global citizenship in order for them to be accountable and act accordingly. This article traces the historical foundations of the concept of global citizenship, its definition and legitimacy. We also list the major skills and values that global citizens must possess in order to act accordingly."
Grammatical Gender Marking: The Gender Roles Mirror,"Shoham, Amir",Cultural values ;  Culture ;  Economic conditions ;  Gender ;  Grammar ;  Language ;  Linguistics ;  Semantics ;  Sex roles ;  Socioeconomic factors,"AIB insights, 2019, Vol.19 (4), p.16-19","This paper highlights the advantages of grammatical gender marking in capturing gender roles in society. Grammatical gender marking is a relatively new method that improves upon the previous methodology of survey-based cultural dimensions, which are susceptible to severe endogeneity problems caused by current socio-economic conditions. Conversely, linguistic structures regarding gender are stable features of a language’s grammar, making them exogenous to current socio-economic forces. Academics can use grammatical gender marking as a quantitative dimension for use in empirical research; practitioners can use it to identify the gender roles affecting foreigner counterparts and host societies."
Gender Fairness in National Pensions,"Goodell, John W.",Cost control ;  Earnings ;  Gender pay gap ;  Inequality ;  Life expectancy ;  Older people ;  Pensions ;  Public policy ;  Retirees ;  Retirement ;  Sustainability,"AIB insights, 2019, Vol.19 (4), p.20-23","International business policy is a growing area of interest. I discuss the relationship between gender fairness, national fiscal challenges, and pension design. Focus is on how the degree of connectedness of pension benefits to earnings history impacts both gender fairness and fiscal sustainability. Gender wage gaps across countries suggest disconnecting pension benefits from earnings history has the potential to provide both greater gender fairness and greater fiscal sustainability. However, as firms design private benefits to optimally offer utility in tandem with national pensions, private firms may compensate by increasing the connection of their benefits to earnings history."

"Yes We Can, But How? Women’s Representation in Global Business","Budde-Song, Amanda ;  Bullough, Amanda ;  Kalafatoglu, Tugba ;  Moore, Fiona",Bias ;  Entrepreneurs ;  Intellectual property ;  Leadership ;  Startups ;  Venture capital,"AIB insights, 2019, Vol.19 (4), p.3-6","Prior research has shown that improving gender equality in the workplace would provide multiple benefits for organizations across sectors and borders. However, despite much work on this goal, women remain woefully underrepresented in the upper echelons of organizations around the world. The problem is that organizations want the benefits that greater gender diversity brings; many are actively trying to achieve those benefits; but they are falling short. This paper investigates this issue and provides several policy suggestions to help organizations better harness the benefits that women can bring across the globe."

Our study revealed that there are currently no female role models within the senior ranks; and few women had progressed into middle management. We position the study within debates around diversity and inclusion and human capacity development in the UK defense sector in general, and specifically the armed forces.

Overall, MNEs tend to avoid countries that are afflicted by armed conflict, a type of political violence that poses a relatively continuous type of risk and can have a large negative impact on a firm’s profits. However, a considerable number of MNEs is attracted to conflict countries. I find that armed conflict positively affects greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI) by the most diversified firms, suggesting that entry into conflict countries might allow firms to obtain a first-mover advantage if MNEs."

The emergence of digital platforms challenges the received strategy and internationalization theories. Due to its multi-sided nature, digital platforms’ internationalization process depends critically on local complementors in the host countries. This dissertation focuses on (1) when music firms may face difficulties in discovering new talent and (2) whether digital technologies or global media companies help them overcome such difficulties. To identify a causal impact, I utilize the staggered entries of iTunes and Youtube into 29 countries."

Second, the role of regional offices in managing regional operations. Third, the unique international opportunities and challenges faced by firms selling fully digital products."

We draw on qualitative evidence from six advanced economy (AMNE) and emerging economy MNEs (EMNE) operating in Uganda and quantitative evidence from fifteen South African EMNEs operating across Africa to argue that the wide-scale reality of institutional environments that differ from those in the developed West should not necessarily imply institutional voids."

Across three studies I find a general preference for familiar countries; however, in certain cases high familiarity can produce spontaneous recollections that lower this preference (inverted-U curvilinear). The influence of country familiarity is moderated by international experience, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, individual international entrepreneurial orientation, and the decision-maker’s cognitive style.

LETTER FROM THE EDITORS,"Rottig, Daniel ;  Mezias, John",Culture ;  Entrepreneurs ;  Entrepreneurship ;  Leadership ;  Organization theory ;  Slavery,"AIB insights, 2018, Vol.18 (2), p.2-2","The authors provide examples for modern slavery in international business, point out the disturbing fact that IB research has largely been silent on the issue, and provide an initial explanation and examination of the subject through the lens of Inst tudonal theot y Snejina Michailova and Christina Stringer then ask, ""What conversations on modern slavery can and should the IB scholarly community address?"" and so encourage you, our valued AIB Insights reader, to learn more about the topic and integrate it into your IB teaching and possibly also your research agenda. The authors discuss several theoretical perspectives that may facilitate a better understanding of the. influences of Clİs on entrepreneurial behaviors across cultures, examine some of the mechanisms by which CLTs may influence cress- cultural ent epreneurship, and sketch out implicao.;,s for IB research, pedagogy and business practice. More specifically, he examines the interesting organizational cultural phenomena of voice and silence, and conceptually explores the national cultural dimensions of power distance as well as individualism and collectivism as direct antecedents of cultures of voice and silence, and the moderating effects of participatory and directive leadership behaviors."

When it comes to income competitiveness, there have been persistent income gaps between CEE countries and the EU average, but they are progressively diminishing. Income convergence in Europe was accompanied by increasing (faster than EU average) share of CEE exports of goods and services in GDP, indicating a growing trade competitiveness. Progressive internationalization of CEE countries was also manifested by augmenting flows of inward FDI, and dynamically growing (however still relatively small) outward FDI, proving the Investment Development Path hypothesis."

CEE markets and MNCs have faded to the background of existing research on emerging markets and emerging market multinationals. The specific CEE context call on IB scholars to re-examine how (foreign and domestically grown) MNCs adapt their strategies in resource-constrained business environments that have undergone incredible socio-economic transitions over the last 25 years, characterized by dynamic institutional evolution, unique transition processes, geographically compressed cultural diversity, sophisticated market behaviour and innovation patterns."

Findings on a sample of 4000 manufacturing firms from Hungary, show that several layers of duality exist parallelly in the economy. One finding is that for the locally owned entities export intensity is the main driver for their performance differences, and foreign subsidiaries can be separated by their relative wage level to the industry average. It suggests that competitiveness policy needs to be adjusted accordingly to promote both economic performance and economic convergence effectively."
OFDI and IFDI Policies Adopted by Central and Eastern European Countries after the Great Recession of 2007-2010,"Götz, Marta",,"AIB insights, 2018, Vol.18 (1)","The significant decline in FDI after the Great Recession, and the accompanying ideological shifts in the role of the state in an economy have called into question the likely changes to be expected in internationalization policies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). An interesting observation from this research is that CEE countries commonly associated with an IFDI welcoming culture and neglectful internationalization policies seem to pursue some opposite policies. They have become less friendly towards IFDI but adopted a more positive approach towards the OFDI. Our research identified one Open, seven Competitive, two Capital-based, and three Closed models."

This research focuses on the role of subsidiary portfolio characteristics that reflect the extent to which overseas subsidiaries are spatially, horizontally, and hierarchically differentiated. Based on the differentiated network view of the MNE, this research argues that the degrees of internal differentiation in the subsidiary portfolio determine the level of managerial complexity faced by headquarters and hence affect expatriate staffing decisions in their subsidiaries. By highlighting the role of subsidiary portfolio characteristics, this thesis provides important new insights into MNE management."

Citing patent filing as evidence of technological catch-up, the article shows how the successful technological advancement of late mover firms from emerging markets was partially due to their creative knowledge sourcing techniques, as well as their balanced approach to pursuing a mix of imitation and innovation strategies."
Creating Shared Value by Combatting Corruption,"Nichols, Philip M.",Confucianism ;  Corruption ;  Costs ;  Emerging markets ;  Empowerment ;  Market penetration ;  Nonprofit organizations ;  Profits ;  Quality ;  Social impact ;  Social responsibility ;  Society,"AIB insights, 2016, Vol.16 (4), p.11","The Creating Shared Value strategy recognizes the embeddedness of a business firm within the social context. Enriching society therefore improves a firm’s productivity and increases opportunities for profit and growth. Corruption seriously damages the social context in which business firms operate, particularly in developing and emerging economies. Business firms, therefore, should work to reduce corruption and thus enhance their own productivity and growth. Research on successful implementation of Creating Shared Value strategies suggests methods for overcoming the most serious difficulties to implementing such strategies, including implementation in emerging economies."
"What You, Readers of AIB Insights, Said: Responses to the Article “Is Your ‘IB’ Research Truly ‘International’?”","Boddewyn, Jean J.",Advantages ;  Multinational corporations ;  Transfer pricing,"AIB insights, 2016, Vol.16 (4), p.18","In his article “Is Your ‘IB’ Research Truly ‘International’?” (published in Volume 16, Issue 2, pages 3-5), Jean Boddewyn invited comments and questions from readers of AIB Insights. Professor Boddewyn received several, which he summarizes here, with some further comments."
Emerging Economies: Differences and Distances,"Ghemawat, Pankaj ;  Altman, Steven A.",,"AIB insights, 2016, Vol.16 (4)","Salient differences between advanced and emerging economies for multinational firms extend well beyond obvious ones such as lower income levels and faster growth. We examine the classification of economies based on levels of development and apply the CAGE (cultural, administrative/institutional, geographic, economic) distance framework to analyze differences and distances between advanced and emerging economies. This analysis covers both internal (unilateral) characteristics of countries and differences/distances that can only be measured bilaterally (across country pairs). A gravity model is employed to consider implications for firms from advanced versus emerging economies."

We introduce a framework that links the underdevelopment of emerging markets to firm internationalization via firms’ characteristics and strategies.  Specifically, we argue that an underdeveloped economy undergoing pro-market transformations and the underdeveloped pro-market institutions, the major characteristics of emerging markets, influence the ownership, capability and innovation of firms and these, in turn, drive their internationalization and success in global competition."

According to an estimate by Shang-Jin Wei (2000, p. 1), ""an increase in the corruption level from that of Singapore to that of Mexico would have the same negative effect on inward FDI as raising the tax rate by fifty percentage points."""
Letter from the Editors: Special Issue on the 2016 Peter J. Buckley and Mark Casson AIB Dissertation Award,"Rottig, Daniel ;  Mezias, John",,"AIB insights, 2016, Vol.16 (3)",This editorial introduces the AIB Insights special issue dedicated to the 2016 Peter J. Buckley and Mark Casson AIB Dissertation Award. It includes introductory articles and these dissertations: “Heterogeneous Implementation of CSR in an MNE: The Role of Subsidiaries’ Institutional Contexts and Behaviors” by Anne Jacqueminet; “Influence of Institutional and Geographical Factors on the Openness and Dispersion of Knowledge-Sourcing Practices” by Marcelo Cano-Kollmann ; “Influences on Transfer Effectiveness: An Exploratory Study of Headquarters Transfer of Capabilities to Subunits in the MNC” by Olof Lindahl; and “Language Strategies in Multinational Corporations: A Cross-Sector Study of Financial Service Companies and Manufacturing Companies” by Guro Sanden.

Buckley and Mark Casson AIB dissertation award. It documents the nature and geographic dispersion of the submissions and the selection process utilized to identify finalists and the winner of the award. The finalist dissertations reflect a broad set of topics related to corporate social responsibility, language strategy, connectivity of peripheral economies and exploration of the role of headquarters in the multinational firm. Posing the right questions, anchoring these questions in theoretical foundations while pursuing cutting edge empirical techniques allows doctoral students to craft a dissertation that is a strong aspirant for the award."
Heterogeneous Implementation of CSR in an MNE: The Role of Subsidiaries’ Institutional Contexts and Behaviors,"Jacqueminet, Anne",Dissertations & theses ;  Essays ;  Fuzzy sets ;  Innovations ;  Institutionalization ;  Multinational corporations ;  Peers ;  Social responsibility ;  Subsidiaries,"AIB insights, 2016, Vol.16 (3), p.9","My dissertation studies what makes an MNE’s subsidiaries implement practices that are consistent with the policy designed by the headquarters. Given the increasing normative pressures for CSR, managing conformity in that domain is of strategic importance. My work relies on a unique set of data (surveys, archival data, interviews) collected in one MNE over three years. The findings show that intra-MNE conformity results not only from diverse pressures exerted on subsidiaries, but also from the subsidiaries’ level of attention to demands, their internalization of the Group policy and the characteristics and institutionalization levels of the practices."
Influences on Transfer Effectiveness: An Exploratory Study of Headquarters Transfer of Capabilities to Subunits in the MNC,"Lindahl, Olof",Cooperation ;  Engineering firms ;  Influence ;  Multinational corporations ;  Studies,"AIB insights, 2016, Vol.16 (3), p.15","The role and limitations of headquarters has rarely been considered in research on headquarters-subsidiary transfer despite a lively stream of research on headquarters ability to manage the multinational corporation in other aspects. This suggests that important influences to transfer effectiveness may have been overlooked. The exploratory study that is introduced in this article investigates what influences headquarters transfer of capabilities to subunits in multinational corporations and identify a number of influences to transfer effectiveness that are new to the literature and, based on these, outlines a number of interesting avenues for future research."
Language Strategies in Multinational Corporations: A Cross-Sector Study of Financial Service Companies and Manufacturing Companies,"Sanden, Guro R.",Blue collar workers ;  Communication ;  Dissertations & theses ;  Employees ;  Financial services ;  Foreign subsidiaries ;  International finance ;  Language policy ;  Linguistics ;  Manufacturing ;  Multilingualism ;  Multinational corporations ;  Recruitment ;  Retail banking ;  Studies,"AIB insights, 2016, Vol.16 (3), p.18","Situated at the intersection of sociolinguistics and international business and management studies, this article focuses on language management in two different industry sectors, namely the financial service sector and the manufacturing sector. Employing a multiple case study design consisting of two matched pair cases, the study examines the means by which language is managed, i.e. language management tools, in two financial service companies and two manufacturing companies. The study contributes to existing literature by capturing the effect of industry sectors on corporate language management – a level of analysis which has largely been overlooked in previous research."
Influence of Institutional and Geographical Factors on the Openness and Dispersion of Knowledge-Sourcing Practices,"Cano-Kollmann, Marcelo",Collaboration ;  Essays ;  Geography ;  Innovations ;  Inventors ;  Privatization ;  Public policy ;  Tacit knowledge,"AIB insights, 2016, Vol.16 (3), p.12","Organizations do not operate in a vacuum. They are embedded in specific geographic locations and are subject to institutional environments that constrain and shape the way they conduct business in general, and innovation activities in particular. This article summarizes my work about how firms adapt their innovative and knowledge-sourcing activities to factors such as geographic peripherality, government monetary and non-monetary support policies, and ownership changes due to pro-market reforms during privatization processes."

There is no shortage of materials and methods that are available to IB instructors including cases, videos, simulations, teaching notes, and articles in the practitioner press. International tax is a provocative, controversial topic which engages students academically and emotionally. Students read of MNEs which pay little tax and want to know: How do they do it? Why are they getting away with it? Furthermore, international tax is synergistic with other IB topics as how business differs when traversing borders and MNE-government bargaining."

Multinationals consequently try to show less taxable income in high-tax jurisdictions and vice versa. The article gives examples of several techniques used to avoid taxes: (i) deferral of double-tax liability, (ii) manipulating invoices in inter-affiliate trade transactions or supply chains, (iii) shifting IP to affiliates or shell companies in low-tax nations or tax-havens which then charge royalties to other international affiliates, (iv) intra-corporate loans, (v) allocation of central overheads to foreign affiliates, and (vi) relocating the entire company to another country. Ethics are discussed from the perspectives of shareholder interests and local governments."

While Russian foreign policy, geo-political developments and mainstream macroeconomic trends (oil prices, inflation) are quite visible to foreign investors and observers, the changes in government regulations of the Russian economy (both official and covert) are often overlooked.  New customs regulations and enforcement practices, development of “grey” customs clearing system, new wave of political restrictions are considered in the article. The authors state that these changes are even more pivotal and impactful than those that occur at the macro-level."

Throughout the second half of the 20th century, this regulatory framework has evolved to facilitate international business, and thus to enable economic globalization. Yet, many treaties have been controversial as citizens do not appreciate their merits relative to their associated restrictions, and governments increasingly realize the costs and risks of the related loss of sovereignty. Concerned citizens resent shifts in bargaining power caused by new treaties, which are feared to limit citizens’ ability to determine their own destiny."
The Outsized Costs of Investor-State Dispute Settlement,"Johnson, Lise ;  Sachs, Lisa",Agreements ;  Costs ;  Foreign investment ;  Host country ;  Human rights ;  Insurance policies ;  International agreements ;  International trade ;  Political risk ;  Politics ;  Rule of law ;  Treaties,"AIB insights, 2016, Vol.16 (1), p.10","The Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanism, included in over 3000 treaties, has raised widespread concerns, particularly as investors increasingly challenge measures related to environmental protection, public health and safety, and financial stability. Even some investors – the purported beneficiaries – have voiced concerns about the costs of proceedings, uncertainty regarding outcomes of disputes, and an absence of rules to ensure the impartiality of arbitrators. As states continue to include ISDS in their treaties, this analysis argues that the costs of ISDS outweigh its alleged benefits, and alternative strategies should be employed to protect investors and promote the rule of law."
Is It Chilly Out There? International Investment Agreements and Government Regulatory Autonomy,"Côté, Christine",Developing countries ;  Foreign investment ;  Globalization ;  International trade ;  LDCs ;  North American Free Trade Agreement ;  Trends,"AIB insights, 2016, Vol.16 (1), p.14","The plain packaging of tobacco products, the disposal of hazardous waste and the management of toxic chemicals are all areas of health, safety and environmental (HSE) regulations which have faced legal challenges by private corporations under international investment agreements (IIAs) and their unique investor state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions, raising concerns about regulatory chill. Research into the Canadian context does not provide support for this concern, but rather finds that regulators are generally not aware of the existence of IIAs or of the potential threat of an ISDS challenge and do not take them into account when developing regulations."
Why Do Countries Commit to ISDS for Disputes with Foreign Investors?,"Jandhyala, Srividya",Arbitration ;  Breach of contract ;  Business forecasts ;  Developing countries ;  Diplomatic & consular services ;  Foreign investment ;  Foreign policy ;  Host country ;  International finance ;  International organizations ;  Intervention ;  LDCs ;  Sovereignty ;  Trade agreements ;  Treaties ;  Tribunals & commissions,"AIB insights, 2016, Vol.16 (1), p.7","To resolve disputes with host governments, foreign investors are increasingly turning to investor-state dispute settlement. Yet, host government commitment to this system constrains their policy space and may cede aspects of sovereign immunity. This paper explores three potential explanations for why so many governments have signed treaty clauses that could hurt them: attracting FDI, unintended policy, and de-politicization of disputes."

While BITs are agreed between Governments, most have enabled foreign investors to internationally sue host States for perceived breaches of treaty provisions. To minimize this risk, India has fundamentally rethought the Most Favoured Nation principle and automatic resort to international arbitration - hallowed tenets underpinning today’s International Investment Agreements (IIA) regime. Interestingly, India has had to narrow the rights and protections it offers investors in disputes, even as it significantly intensifies efforts to attract them."

While respondents were motivated by cost savings and quality improvements, they faced challenges of intellectual property protection and variation between anticipated and landed cost savings. The choice of governance mode was critical to the achievement of competitive benefits. Governance structures reflected institutional weaknesses in China and firms reported a high rate of mode switching. Mode switching could be an alternative to reshoring where it enables outsourcers to respond to changing cost and regulatory conditions or to correct locally suboptimal arrangement."

Our data exhibits 501 reshoring cases of manufacturing activities (especially in fashion and electronics industries) from emerging to advanced (e.g. U.S. and Germany) countries mainly due to cost reasons; conversely, the back-reshoring of business functions is still a limited phenomenon."

Chapter one examines the impact of the subunit scope (functional and geographical breadth) over the project’s efficiency. Chapter two analyzes the role of experience in shaping a firm’s value chain internationalization. Chapter three explores how changes in the organizational architecture of a fine-slicing project affect capability development. The thesis contributes by guiding managers to see fine-slicing not as a one-time strategic decision, but rather one that is sensitive to architectural variables and learning/behavioral processes."

The results are grounded on a database, which contains all the investment deals by EMNEs in the EU between 2003 and 2011. It shows that agglomeration economies play a key role in attracting investments from emerging economies, which tend to concentrate in areas with a massive presence of firms in the same industries."

In this essay, I speak about my personal experience in trying to obtain a visa, and reflect how visas act as a barrier to full participation in the global economy, both economically and in the cross-border sharing of knowledge. I suggest the possible value of a global oversight body to regulate how visas are granted."

Social (e.g., pro-inclusion of marginalized or excluded groups) and environmental priorities have joined conventional economic development objectives, creating a demand for multidisciplinary research that is multidimensional in its recommendations. To meet this, the Global Academic Policy Research Network on Investment for Development was launched, with an ambitious agenda, during the 2014 World Investment Forum (WIF) at UNCTAD, in Geneva."

Solid practical experiences are also a “must”. In the German higher education system, the acquisition of practical experience is firmly anchored in study and examination regulations as far as “universities of applied sciences” are concerned. Compared to traditional universities, universities of applied sciences focus more on applied research, cooperate very closely with industry, and actually provide the German labor market with almost 60% of engineering and business graduates."

Contrary to the established view, it suggests that these industries experience a wider geographic circumference of innovation that spans even the emerging economies. The increasing appearance of new locations in the global innovation systems of these industries indicates lower barriers to entry and weaker first mover advantages for locations."

New theoretical frameworks, such as the Linkage-Leverage- Learning (LLL) framework, competing with the traditional ones, such as the Ownership-Location-Internalisation (OLI) framework, have been put forward to explain their idiosyncratic behaviour. Using a database on foreign acquisitions undertaken by Indian multinational enterprises, this study tests these theoretical frameworks and reconciles differences between them"

The Organizational Design of Offshoring,"Larsen, Marcus M.",Architecture ;  Costs ;  International organizations ;  Organizational change ;  Outsourcing ;  Relocation of industry,"AIB insights, 2014, Vol.14 (3), p.10","This short article summarizes my PhD dissertation entitled ‘The Organizational Design of Offshoring’ that has as its purpose to investigate why some firms fail when offshoring and other do not. The thesis consists of four research papers using various datasets and methodologies that investigate offshoring in an organizational context. It is argued that whether firms relocate activities with the purpose of accessing resources or as a response to political pressures, the process of offshoring presents firms and their decision makers with the daunting challenge of recognizing the need for coordinating and integrating offshoring activities in a global organization."

In an age where the relocation of business activities abroad is common practice, this is an important — yet largely ignored — question with central implications for both research and practice. This dissertation summary suggests that offshoring initiates a more fundamental reconfiguration process that essentially challenges firms’ capacity to manage the complexities of operating an international organization."
AIB Dissertation Awards: The Early Years (1968-1985),"Daniels, John D. ;  de la Torre, José R.",,"AIB insights, 2014, Vol.14 (3), p.5","We describe the first 18 years of AIB’s dissertation awards since 1968 along with the evolution of selection processes and presentation procedures. Over this time, the profiles of winners and their degree granting institutions grew increasingly diverse, as did the topics of dissertations in terms of functions, operating modes, and locations. We were disappointed that AIB maintained few award records and that only about one-third of living winners are currently members. Thus, we recommend AIB establish searchable data bases for all award competitors as well as stronger efforts to engage former winners, such as by inviting them for special panels."

Comments from the Guest Editor: Stepping on Cultural and Religious Assumptions,"Littrell, Romie Frederick ;  Rottig, Daniel",,"AIB insights, 2014, Vol.14 (2)",This editorial article introduces a special issue of AIB Insights focused on a cross-cultural class exercise controversy that occurred in the USA the prior year. The issue includes “Stepping on Cultural and Religious Assumptions” by Mark F. Peterson; “Managing Deep Intercultural Training Exercises” by Martha Maznevski; “Issues in Uncovering Hidden Identities in Intercultural Training” by Brent J. Lyons; and “Informed Consent for CrossCultural Classroom Exercises: Teaching Tool or Wishful Thinking?” by David E.L. Herst.
Managing Deep Intercultural Training Exercises,"Maznevski, Martha",Cultural differences ;  Social identity ;  Teaching methods,"AIB insights, 2014, Vol.14 (2), p.7","This paper considers how deeply intercultural training probes into students’ most basic social identity and self-image. Much of the discussion is about how a trainer can gradually build trust to provide a supportive context for deep self-awareness and questioning of one’s assumptions. It addresses the concern that trainers should take care about intervening too deeply by providing a training process view. Rather than explaining how a trainer knows what “too deep” means in advance, it explains how to judge when training touches on areas that their students are not prepared to consider and how to adjust training at such points."

It does so using five issues raised in the medical and research ethics literatures: voluntarism, capacity, disclosure, understanding, decision."

Using the example of religious identity and the “Step on Jesus” exercise, I describe the disclosure dilemma brought forward in an intercultural training exercise and how this activity can pose challenges for students with religious identities. I also identify strategies teachers can adopt to facilitate intercultural training that is sensitive to disclosure dilemmas faced by students."
Stepping on Cultural and Religious Assumptions,"Peterson, Mark F.",Cultural differences ;  Disclosure ;  International ;  Religion ;  Training,"AIB insights, 2014, Vol.14 (2), p.4","This essay suggests that we should think of ourselves not only as individual culture trainers but also as a community. We should also think of our students both as individuals and as points of contact with larger cultural communities. As individual cultural trainers, we should reflect on our personal assumptions about why and how we challenge our students’ most basic self-schemas and social identities. As a community of cultural scholars, we also should reconsider our professional norms. Our norms may sometimes direct us to unnecessarily stigmatize our students’ cultural backgrounds and trigger undesirable, but predictable, responses from their cultural communities."

It seems that the re-emergence of China on the world stage is not only creating a multi-polar world, but also brings back ancient trade routes like the Manila Galleon or the Silk Road. The new relative position of China in the world has led to a big temptation to dance with the dragon, but where can the dragon take you? The relationship with China for many Latin American states will be transformative, a source of “concern” for the US as well as for some of the Latin American states who are themselves beneficiaries."
China’s Economic Impact on Oceania,"Enderwick, Peter",,"AIB insights, 2014, Vol.14 (1)","China has a strong and growing presence in the Oceania region which supplies a range of key resources, particularly minerals and foodstuffs. The region has historically attracted Chinese migrants. While Oceania benefits from trade, investment, and migration links with China there is concern over the establishment of Chinese organised crime groups in the Pacific Islands many of which suffer poor governance, corruption, and instability. There is also recent evidence of China’s political engagement in the region with regard to Taiwan and the Belt and Road Initiative."

However, the key role that China now plays in Africa has largely gone unstudied. It is necessary to begin any analysis of Chinese management and organizations in Africa by attempting to understand China’s motives being there without assuming it has the same motivations as the West. Also, more studies are needed to get the knowledge about what happens when Chinese firms go abroad, what Chinese firms take to Africa, and the synergies between Chinese management philosophies and practices and their African partners, staffs and communities."

China's Economic Impact on Oceania1,"Enderwick, Peter",Accounting ;  Economic development ;  Economic impact ;  Exports ;  Foreign investment ;  International trade ;  Trade agreements ;  Trade relations,"AIB insights, 2014, Vol.14 (1), p.3","China has a strong economic presence in the South Pacific, a region sometimes termed Oceania. This region is defined to include islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean, which lie south of the tropic of Cancer, including Australia and New Zealand. Oceania is a region of significant diversity in terms of both population and land size. Populations range from just 10,000 in the islands of Nauru and Tuvalu to the comparatively much larger populations found in New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Australia. Trade with China is extremely important for almost all economies in Oceania. This is not surprising given the fact that in 2012 China surpassed the US to become the world's largest trading nation in terms of total imports and exports. Economic relations between Oceania and China extend well beyond just trade. One of the most controversial linkages is through foreign direct investment, and in particular, the rapid rise in outward Chinese investment."

Up to recently the focus on China was as a large potential market for the West: management scholarship tends to follow the blue chip companies. Yet this has been changing over the last few years, to focus on China in the world, to look more closely not at international joint ventures in China, not at Western corporations working with Chinese partners in China, but at Chinese MNCs operating across international markets. To assess the claim that China is the new imperialist in Africa, it is necessary to first look at the West's history of involvement in Africa, which is quite different to that of China. Certainly China's motive has been commerce rather than stressing a need for Africa's political and economic reform in contradistinction to the West that sought to introduce a neoliberal ideal. It appears not to have been a ""civilizing"" nor a proselytizing motive."

Born Global in Bangalore: Emergent Pathways for International New Ventures via Multinational Enterprise Networks,"Prashantham, Shameen",,"AIB insights, 2013, Vol.13 (4)","I briefly describe three new ventures in Bangalore, India that were founded at different stages of the local entrepreneurial ecosystem’s maturation process, and all internationalized from inception. As the Bangalore entrepreneurial ecosystem matured, the ventures engaged in progressively closer partnerships with the local subsidiaries of foreign multinationals that facilitated their (the new ventures’) internationalization. Thus I point to an upward trajectory in, and interface between, innovation activities of both foreign MNEs and indigenous new ventures. An important implication for international entrepreneurship research is the opportunity (and necessity) to explicitly incorporate the role of partnerships with large MNEs in future research."

Using the tools of network theory and insights from the entrepreneurship, social psychology, and civic or political participation literatures, the author presents a stakeholder influence strategy for firms to navigate nonmarket uncertainty by engendering cooperative relations, increasing tie formation and minimizing conflict with their stakeholders. The dissertation explores this network-based influence strategy within an industry characterized by significant nonmarket uncertainty—the global gold mining industry."

The first paper asks whether foreign entrepreneurial firms perform better with a foreign owner-manager or a hired domestic manager. The second paper investigates how foreign entrepreneurs’ personal relocation preferences may affect their decisions to manage their own firms and draws out implications for venture performance. The final paper explores how media coverage of a city affects location choices of foreign firms and how this effect varies for investors with little private information, such as foreign entrepreneurs."

"British Multinationals in South East Asia: Strategy, Subsidiaries and Performance","Nguyen, Quyen T.K.",,"AIB insights, 2013, Vol.13 (3)","This thesis builds upon internalization theory in the international business literature and the pecking order theory in the finance literature to examine the relationship between subsidiary-specific advantages (SSAs), strategies and performance. Specifically, it theorizes that internal financing and subsidiary-level financial management capability are conceptually just as valuable as other traditional competitive advantages in R&D, marketing and managerial skills. It uses a survey dataset with the South East Asian subsidiaries of British multinational enterprises to empirically test a set of hypotheses. The empirical findings lead to advance on the theoretical concept of SSAs and show that SSAs enhance the subsidiary performance."

The results of this study indicate that emerging market (EM) firms that become embedded in advanced economies experience negative performance effects in the short run but realize positive performance outcomes in the long run. Contrary to the intuitively-appealing prediction of the theory of incremental internationalization, the results suggest that EM firms realize greater performance benefits when they expand to more institutionally-distant advanced economies."

Personal Experiences of Oppression of Women Stereotypes in the Middle East: Both East and West are Guilty,"Abdelzaher, Dina M. ;  Bullough, Amanda",,"AIB insights, 2013, Vol.13 (2)","Researchers need to isolate their own personal biases if we are to conduct truth – seeking culture research, even though this is difficult. In our study of Afghan and Saudi women on how family and collectivism impact entrepreneurial success/intention, we find that even within MiddleEastern Muslim women there are evident biases on their perceived degree of oppression. We conclude that both easterners and westerners are guilty of wrongfully stereotyping these women as “oppressed”, which can be attributed to poor understanding of social norms that shape their behaviors, which can be regarded as legitimate in the eyes of the so called “oppressee”."
Featured Commentary: Special Issue on the Middle East North Africa Region,"Balakrishnan, Melodena Stephens",,"AIB insights, 2013, Vol.13 (2)","The MENA region is filled with contrasts. Though some of the oldest civilizations exist here, there are still geographical boundaries that are undefined, such as Palestine (home to ten million people). The Arab Spring, which began at the end of 2010, has led to mass migration of over one million people from Tunisia, Libya, and Syria that surged to neighbouring countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe, creating a humanitarian crisis. There is a need to redefine the boundaries of IB from an emerging market context and look at new topics as globalisation, not internationalisation, will drive the world!"
Building Political Risk Management Skills in the Middle East,"Rogmans, Tim J.",,"AIB insights, 2013, Vol.13 (2)","Global markets are increasingly characterized by political risk and uncertainty, nowhere more so than in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region. In this environment, are there are any good reasons for companies to invest in the region? What are the entry methods and ownership modes that successful companies use when faced with political turmoil? A number of multinational companies are aware that there are fundamental strengths in the economies in the region that are likely to endure and are taking action to capitalize on the opportunities. This article provides valuable advice on risk management in the region."
Replicating and Extending Cross-National Value Studies: Rewards and Pitfalls–An Example Middle East Studies,"Hofstede, Geert",,"AIB insights, 2013, Vol.13 (2)","This article continues the discussion of methodology issues in cross-cultural research from AIB Insights issue 4 of 2012. It specifically addresses the failure to employ matched samples in comparative, cross-cultural studies, based on a Middle Eastern context, and so illustrates how to properly examine cultural differences in the region."

Commercial Diplomacy and International Business: Inseparable Twins?,"Ruël, Huub J.M. ;  Lee, Donna ;  Visser, Robin",,"AIB insights, 2013, Vol.13 (1)","This article discusses the relationships between government and business, relating commercial diplomacy and international business success. It calls for more research on commercial diplomacy by international business scholars.

The Domain of International Business and the AIB,"Collinson, Simon ;  Doz, Yves ;  Kostova, Tatiana ;  Liesch, Peter ;  Roth, Kendall",,"AIB insights, 2013, Vol.13 (1)","This article discusses research, teaching, and engagement in international business. The article aims to capture some kind of consensus, identify where new challenges might prompt a revision of the IB domain, and outline any implications for the scope and activities of the AIB. To do so, it focuses on the distinctive characteristics and features, boundaries and benchmarks of IB, a legitimate curriculum for the teaching of IB globally, accreditation of any IB teaching programme, and the main stakeholders and interest groups that we are (or should be) connected to."
"What Is, and to What Purpose Do We Study, International Business?","Meyer, Klaus E.",,"AIB insights, 2013, Vol.13 (1)","In the globalized, “flat” world, do we still need a special field of study called “international business”? Yes, we do, and more than ever. Opportunities to engage across national borders are rapidly growing in scope and complexity, while only marginally reducing the challenges of managing across borders. IB scholars explore how and why cross-national differences matter and how businesses are able to transcend national (and other) differences. To this end, we integrate context and general theory, which allows us to not only advance theories but also use our research to contribute to major debates in management practice and politics."
