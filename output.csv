0,Geopolitics of the Digital Economy: Implications for States and Firms,"Lawton, Thomas C. ; Tonn Goulart Moura, Stephanie ; Tobin, Damian ; Silva-Rêgo, Bernardo","digital economy, geopolitics, international business strategy, structural power","[...]data are the foremost and most fundamental assets of the digital world, underpinning corporate success and national security. Contemporary geopolitical power is also increasingly based on access to and the use of data and technology, but the source of this power is often contested. Since firms and governments are fundamental actors in geopolitical power dynamics, we discuss the practical implications of these digital power dynamics based on Strange's (2015) power structures. Many tasks, such as market trading and data gathering, can be carried out remotely and performed more efficiently through artificial intelligence. [...]the control of cyberspace is also the control of global production in the digital era. KNOWLEDGE PILLAR Knowledge is capable of shaping all other structures of power (production, security, and finance) because it creates asymmetries of information, which produces privileges for one party over another (Jacobs, 2016). [...]power resides in producing, controlling, and transforming data into knowledge.","AIB insights, 2023"
1,Media in the Geopolitical Crossfire: Identification and Novel Data Sources for IB Research,"Puhr, Harald ; Kupfer, Alexander","GDELT, Google Trends, geopolitics, media, issue salience","[...]consideration of alternative data sources such as Google Trends that suffer less from direct political interference. [...]under the assumption that information supply by the media corresponds to information demand in society, the more intense reporting on an issue, the greater the issue's salience - the importance that society assigns to it (Dennison, 2019). [...]the link a Contact author: harald.puhr@uibk.ac.at between information supplied by the media and information demanded by society weakens and media analysis provides a distorted view on issue salience. [...]during phases of high geopolitical tension, such as inter-state conflicts, power struggles, or foreign intervention, pressure on the media rises (Mejias & Vokuev, 2017).","AIB insights, 2023"
2,Assessing Geopolitical Risk: A Multi-Level Approach for Top Managers of Multinationals,"De Villa, Maria A.","geopolitics, geopolitical risk, risk assessment","[...]this article offers top managers a multi-level approach for the holistic assessment of geopolitical risk that can help them identify their multinational's degree of exposure. According to the U.S. National Intelligence Council's report Global Trends 2040: A More Contested World, ""no single state is likely to be positioned to dominate across all regions or domains, and...[states] will compete to advance their ideologies, goals, and interests"" (U.S. National Intelligence Council, 2021: 92). [...]geopolitical risk - the threat, realization, and escalation of adverse events associated with wars, terrorism, and any tensions among states and political actors that affect the peaceful course of international relations (Caldara & Ia-coviello, 2022: 1195) - is likely to increase in the next two decades. [...]this article goes beyond local politics and tackles geopolitical complexity by offering top managers a multi-level approach for the holistic assessment of geopolitical risk that can help them identify their multinational's degree of exposure. [...]of the ban, Huawei smartphones were suddenly unable to offer Google apps.","AIB insights, 2023"

5,"Managing, Structuring and Scaling Innovation in International Organizations","Tatarinov, Katherine","innovation, scaling, international organizations, digital solutions, wicked problems, transformation","This article summarizes my award-winning dissertation on innovation for transforming the United Nations (UN) to solve the grand challenges in a technologically evolving world. It answers: how do the processes of managing, structuring and scaling innovation impact international organizations and the fulfilment of their missions? Findings show that innovative initiatives lead to the development of responsible innovation capacity, that scaling digital solutions for wicked problems requires global/local ecosystem actors to take on new roles in each location, and that innovation units create value through relationships not owned by one party. These contributions exhibit the cross-sectoral potential for delivering global impact through innovation. It also shows that IB scholars have the frameworks and tools to move beyond traditional contexts to address real problems in the global economy.","AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (4)"
6,Iterate to Innovate: How Firms Strategize Design Iteration to Navigate the Uneven Landscape in the Global Mobile Application Industry,"Zhang, Pengxiang","design iteration, opportunity logic, institutional conditions, regular rhythms, nascent market, digital innovation","Digital firms constantly iterate products to capture innovation opportunities. As digitalization transforms the global marketplace, firms all over the world must strategize iteration across various institutional contexts. My dissertation starts by establishing that firms need to be cautious about introducing iteration given its demand-side costs. Further, I find that frequent iterations enable digital firms to become innovative in uncertain institutional environments compared to stable environments. Moreover, iterating with regular rhythms help firms diversify across platform markets, but not so if firms diversify across heterogeneous country markets. Hence, both institutional conditions and market diversification must be considered when strategizing iteration.","AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (4), p.1-5"
7,General Manager Succession in Multinational Enterprise Subsidiaries,"Li, Liang (Arthur)","subsidiary management, micro-foundations, subsidiary performance, successor origin, managerial succession","This dissertation, based on interviews with over 40 managers and quantitative data on over 1,900 foreign subsidiaries, aims to provide new insights regarding subsidiary general manager (GM) changes in multinational enterprises (MNEs). I study continual GM change, individual succession event, the decision-making process through which different types of subsidiary GM successors are selected, and how they link to subsidiary performance. I found that GM succession decisions are path dependent and evolving, can be influenced by MNE environments, and need to be based on both GM successor nationality and origin. My dissertation underscores the complexity of subsidiary GM succession and bridges succession strategy with implementation.","AIB insights, 2022, Vol.22 (4), p.1-5"
