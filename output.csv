Developing a conceptual model of small independent retailers in developing economies: the roles of embeddedness and subsistence markets,"Sarkar, Dev Narayan ;  Kundu, Kaushik ;  Chaudhuri, Himadri Roy",,"AMS review, 2016, Vol.6 (3-4), p.176-193",
Designing conceptual articles: four approaches,"Jaakkola, Elina",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (1-2), p.18-26","As a powerful means of theory building, conceptual articles are increasingly called for in marketing academia. However, researchers struggle to design and write non-empirical articles because of the lack of commonly accepted templates to guide their development. The aim of this paper is to highlight methodological considerations for conceptual papers: it is argued that such papers must be grounded in a clear research design, and that the choice of theories and their role in the analysis must be explicated and justified. The paper discusses four potential templates for conceptual papers – Theory Synthesis, Theory Adaptation, Typology, and Model – and their respective aims, approach for using theories, and contribution potential. Supported by illustrative examples, these templates codify some of the tacit knowledge that underpins the design of non-empirical papers and will be of use to anyone undertaking, supervising, or reviewing conceptual research."
"Reflections on customer-based brand equity: perspectives, progress, and priorities","Keller, Kevin Lane",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2016, Vol.6 (1-2), p.1-16","“Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity,” published in the
Journal of Marketing
in 1993, was one of the early thought pieces and review papers on branding in the field. Written to be a comprehensive bridge between the theory and practice of branding, it has received a large number of citations and several awards through the years. Here, I look back at that article and provide some perspective as to how it was developed, highlighting some of its main contributions. I also outline some of my subsequent related branding research, as well as that of others. Finally, I consider some future research priorities in branding, putting emphasis on the online and digital developments that have occurred since the publication of the article."
A conceptual perspective on collaborative consumption,"Ertz, Myriam ;  Durif, Fabien ;  Arcand, Manon",Business and Management ;  Collaboration ;  Consumption ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (1-2), p.27-41","While considerable investigative work has focused on collaborative consumption (CC) from a managerial standpoint, the concept still lacks the conceptual groundwork necessary to categorize and fully understand its scopes and limits. In this article, the authors draw upon past research to delineate the construct, discuss its dimensionalities, and propose a conceptualization of CC. The CC concept is based on six key thrusts: (1) the consumer’s ability to switch sides; (2) the collaboration intensity; (3) the manner in which consumers partake in CC; (4) the transfer of ownership and use; (5) the channels used; and (6) the extended range of stakeholders in collaborative exchanges. This analytical endeavour brings to the fore the multidimensional aspect of CC, the centrality of a two-sided instead of a one-sided consumer role, and the extent to which both CC (collaborative consumption) and conventional consumption (conventional economy) are tightly interrelated."
Toward a theory of ethical consumer intention formation: re-extending the theory of planned behavior,"Sun, William",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.260-278","What drives consumers to purchase or not purchase ethical products remains something of a puzzle for consumer behavior researchers. Existing theory—particularly the widely applied theory of planned behavior (TPB)—cannot fully explain ethical purchase decisions. This article contends that not only is the original TPB limited in its applicability to ethical purchasing contexts but also subsequent modifications to it have been generally unfitting. This study advances the literature by taking a different approach to recharacterize and re-extend the original components of the TPB in order to make it more relevant and effective for explaining and predicting ethical consumer decisions. This new theoretical framework of intention formation features four determinants (attitude, subjective norm, moral identity, and perceived behavior control) and a key moderator (level of confidence), and thereby possesses better explanatory and predictive abilities to understand ethical consumer decisions."
Toward an integrative theory of marketing,"Parvatiyar, Atul ;  Sheth, Jagdish N.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.432-445","Many scholars have observed that the marketing discipline has become too fragmented and myopic, straying away from its core managerial marketing issues. To some, the complex discipline-transgressing phenomena are knowledge-producing, while for others, it is the discipline's problem of an identity crisis. This article argues that continuities and discontinuities of theoretical and methodological processes result from the contextual forces that continuously create new perspectives, paradigms, and schools of thought. Many traditional schools of marketing thought have either become obsolete or metamorphosized into new schools of thought. It has led to several theoretical advances that promise to develop into a general theory of marketing. However, none have grown into a full-blown integrative theory of marketing to tie in the various subdisciplines of marketing. We present an overall framework of marketing that could become the basis for developing an integrative theory of marketing with views relating to the core marketing processes and how the evolving contextual forces interactively impact them."
"Conducting field-based, discovery-oriented research: lessons from our market orientation research experience","Jaworski, Bernard J. ;  Kohli, Ajay K.",Business and Management ;  Market orientation ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2017, Vol.7 (1-2), p.4-12","The purpose of this article is to surface lessons we learned in course of doing our article on market orientation (Kohli and Jaworski
Journal of Marketing, 54
, 1-18
1990
). These lessons are intended to provide specific guidance for scholars – particularly PhD students and junior faculty – interested in developing new constructs and theories related to them. We organize the lessons into four sections that reflect the end-to-end research process. Specifically, the paper is organized around issues relating to: (a) choosing whether and what to study, (b) with whom to study it, (c) doing the research, and (d) crafting the findings. For each section, we identify one or more lessons or principles that we believe generalize to a broader research context. We conclude with a set of ideas for future research on market orientation, especially those that could benefit from field-based studies."
Consciousness for sustainable consumption: scale development and new insights in the economic dimension of consumers’ sustainability,"Balderjahn, Ingo ;  Buerke, Anja ;  Kirchgeorg, Manfred ;  Peyer, Mathias ;  Seegebarth, Barbara ;  Wiedmann, Klaus-Peter",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2013, Vol.3 (4), p.181-192","The “triple bottom line” concept (planet, people, and profit) represents an important guideline for the sustainable, hence future-oriented, development of societies and for the behaviors of all societal members. For institutions promoting societal change, as well as for companies being confronted with growing expectations regarding compelling contributions to sustainable changes, it is of great importance to know if, and to what extent, consumers have already internalized the idea of sustainability. Against the background of existing research gaps regarding a comprehensive measurement of the consciousness for sustainable consumption (CSC), the authors present the result of a scale development. Consciousness was operationalized by weighting personal beliefs with the importance attached by consumers to sustainability dimensions. Four separate tests of the CSC scale indicated an appropriate psychometric quality of the scale and provided support for this new measurement approach that incorporates the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability."
Marketing’s theoretical and conceptual value proposition: opportunities to address marketing’s influence,"Key, Thomas Martin ;  Clark, Terry ;  Ferrell, OC ;  Stewart, David W. ;  Pitt, Leyland",Business and Management ;  Conceptual ;  Conceptual and theoretical research ;  Discipline drift ;  Discipline myopia ;  Marketing ;  Marketing influence ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.151-167","This paper is composed of scholarly essays that explore the problematic nature of marketing’s influence within the academy and organizations, potential explanations and causes, and how conceptual and theoretical research can address and move our discipline forward. Each section represents material and research developed through interactive sessions from Academy of Marketing Science conferences. Topics include the history of the marketing discipline, its innovation and loss of domain expertise; important internal and external environmental concepts that have impeded relevance and theoretical impact; foundational elements of how the discipline frames problems, provides methodological-based solutions, and influences the very subjects of our research in such a way as to lesson our contribution to scholarship and practice; and finally the discipline’s inability to understand the intangible nature of marketing activities and outcomes, as well as marketers’ struggle to articulate relevance in a way that is easily understood in the language of finance. Through this critical self-examination of the field of marketing a central premise emerged—a discipline-wide drift and myopic approach to rigor and relevance."
Service innovation is urgent in healthcare,"Berry, Leonard L.",Business and Management ;  Innovations ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (1-2), p.78-92","Healthcare is a service setting where meeting the needs of customers (patients and their families) is uniquely challenging. But the necessity, complexity, cost, and high-emotion nature of the service, as well as technological advances and competitive dynamics in the industry, make the imperative for
service innovation
in healthcare especially urgent. Forward-thinking healthcare institutions around the United States are succeeding in establishing a value-creating innovation culture and in implementing operational and strategic service innovations that benefit them and their stakeholders. They view continuous innovation as a non-negotiable goal, prize institutional self-confidence, and include patients and families on the innovation team. Cancer care, in particular, faces a pressing need for service innovation, and some progressive oncology centers are demonstrating what is possible to improve the patient and family service experience. The imperatives, now, are for service innovation to become part of the fabric of how all healthcare institutions, not just the groundbreakers discussed in this article, operate—and for academics in the field of marketing to play a crucial role in that effort."
Conceptual review papers: revisiting existing research to develop and refine theory,"Hulland, John",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (1-2), p.27-35","Conceptual review papers can theoretically enrich the field of marketing by reviewing extant knowledge, noting tensions and inconsistencies, identifying important gaps as well as key insights, and proposing agendas for future research. The result of this process is a theoretical contribution that refines, reconceptualizes, or even replaces existing ways of viewing a phenomenon. This paper spells out the primary aims of conceptual reviews and clarifies how they differ from other theory development efforts. It also describes elements essential to a strong conceptual review paper and offers a specific set of best practices that can be used to distinguish a strong conceptual review from a weak one."
Theorizing markets,"Kjellberg, Hans ;  Murto, Riikka",Business and Management ;  Editorial ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.207-215",
Consequences of mandated usage of innovations in organizations: developing an innovation decision model of symbolic and forced adoption,"Heidenreich, Sven ;  Talke, Katrin",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.279-298","In organizations, mandated adoption contexts are the rule rather than the exception. Individuals, who are denied the choice between adopting and rejecting an innovation, are more likely to engage in opposition behavior, particularly if the innovation conflicts with their held beliefs. Interestingly, neither the construct of forced adoption nor its consequences have received much research attention. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review and provide theoretical rationales for the emergence of innovation resistance and opposition behaviors in organizations. We then develop an innovation decision model of individual adoption behavior that localizes negative outcomes of the secondary adoption process along the different process stages, providing insights into their emergence and potential consequences for the organization. Furthermore, we identify important avenues for future research and show how our innovation decision model can be used to advance theory development on forced adoption."
Stakeholder marketing: a definition and conceptual framework,"Hult, G. Tomas M. ;  Mena, Jeannette A. ;  Ferrell, O. C. ;  Ferrell, Linda",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2011, Vol.1 (1), p.44-65","Stakeholder marketing has established foundational support for redefining and broadening the marketing discipline. An extensive literature review of 58 marketing articles that address six primary stakeholder groups (i.e., customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders, regulators, and the local community) provides evidence of the important role the groups play in stakeholder marketing. Based on this review and in conjunction with established marketing theory, we define stakeholder marketing as “activities and processes within a system of social institutions that facilitate and maintain value through exchange relationships with multiple stakeholders.” In an effort to focus on the stakeholder marketing field of study, we offer both a conceptual framework for understanding the pivotal role of stakeholder marketing and research questions for examining the linkages among stakeholder exchanges, value creation, and marketing outcomes."
The Möbius strip of market spatiality: mobilizing transdisciplinary dialogues between CCT and the marketing mainstream,"Coffin, Jack ;  Chatzidakis, Andreas",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.40-59","This paper develops the Möbius strip as an ‘ordering theory’ (Sandberg and Alvesson,
2020
) that brings CCT studies into dialogue with mainstream marketing approaches. The aim is to work toward a transdisciplinary understanding of market spatiality, a topic that has become increasingly important for theorists and practitioners (Warnaby and Medway,
2013
; Castilhos et al., 
2016
; Chatzidakis et al., 
2018
). Building on psychosocial interpretations of the Möbius strip as a ‘tactical’ way of thinking, a range of insights and ideas are organized along a single strip of theorization. This paper maps a continuous plane of logic between the concepts of space, place, emplacement, spatiality, implacement, and displacement. The potential applications of the Möbius strip are then demonstrated by showing how the transdisciplinary topic of ‘atmosphere’ can be theorized from multiple perspectives. The paper concludes by exploring how the Möbius strip might also be employed in other areas of marketing theory and practice, potentially generating further transdisciplinary conversations between CCT and the marketing mainstream."
Re-examining utopia in contemporary consumption: conceptualization and implications for marketing,"Atanasova, Aleksandrina",Business and Management ;  Conceptual ;  Desire ;  Escape ;  Experiential consumption ;  Liquid consumption ;  Marketing ;  Retailing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory ;  Theory/Conceptual ;  Utopia,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.23-39","This paper introduces liquid consumer utopias, defined as market-mediated expressions of individuals’ desires to re-imagine and re-construct reality, and to re-frame the present. This conceptual lens illuminates previously untheorized consumption phenomena, which are socially constructed, and often critical, efforts to enact an alternative way of being in an increasingly uncertain and unpredictable world. Three key characteristics of liquid utopias are outlined—immediacy, transience and hyper-individualization––each pointing to liquid consumer utopias’ function to facilitate present-oriented and short-lived re-imaginings of reality. Co-existing alongside the solid and collective utopian consumption of interest to prior research, these emergent forms of liquid consumer utopias articulate a re-imagining of the present (rather than the future), have an emphasis on individual (rather than communal) experiences of betterment, and an orientation toward temporary re-framings of the experienced reality (rather than a pursuit of permanence and long-lasting change). Implications are discussed for retailing, experiential consumption, and consumer self-optimization."
Sustainable marketing based on virtue ethics: addressing socio-ecological challenges facing humankind,"Dyck, Bruno ;  Manchanda, Rajesh V.",Business and Management ;  Conceptual ;  Ethics ;  Marketing ;  Marketing 4 Ps ;  Marketing-mix paradigm ;  Social Sciences ;  Sustainability ;  Theory ;  Theory/Conceptual ;  Triple Bottom Line ;  Utilitarian ethics ;  Virtue ethics,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.115-132","It is generally accepted that the primary goal of marketing, even conventional sustainable marketing, is to enhance organizations’ financial well-being, a view that is consistent with mainstream utilitarian ethics. However, this profit-first focus often inadvertently contributes to socio-ecological problems and undermines the ability of marketing to adequately address resulting challenges. This paper presents an approach to sustainable marketing that we call Social and Ecological Thought (SET) marketing, which is based on virtue ethics and aims to optimize social and ecological well-being while ensuring financial viability. We describe implications of SET marketing for each of the 4 Ps in the marketing-mix paradigm—product, price, place, and promotion—and compare them to conventional views based on mainstream utilitarian ethics. SET marketing is relevant for the growing number of consumers and businesses that willingly forgo the maximization of financial well-being in order to optimize socio-ecological well-being. Implications for theory and practice are discussed."
Understanding the do-it-yourself consumer: DIY motivations and outcomes,"Wolf, Marco ;  McQuitty, Shaun",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2011, Vol.1 (3-4), p.154-170","Do-it-yourself (DIY) is an increasingly popular consumer behavior, but little is known about this large consumer segment. We undertake a depth interview study and review diverse literatures to develop a conceptual model of DIY behavior that explores the reasons why consumers DIY and the benefits they receive. The purpose of the model is to improve our understanding of a consumer segment that, in many ways, behaves differently from typical consumers. Research propositions are derived and discussions of implications and ideas for future research follow."
The new frontier of consumer experiences: escape through pain,"Cova, Bernard",Anti-structure ;  Business and Management ;  CCT ;  Conceptual ;  Consumers ;  Escape ;  Experience ;  Humanities and Social Sciences ;  Marketing ;  Orwell ;  Pain ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory ;  Theory/Conceptual ;  Whitening,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.60-69","Terms such as
consumer experience
and
experiential consumption
have become ubiquitous in the realm of marketing. The last decades have seen a dramatic increase in academic publications exploring these concepts across many different streams and have resulted in significant advances in scholarly understanding. Consumer culture theory (CCT) scholars have particularly participated in this effort by investigating extraordinary experiences and framing them as escapes from everyday life. This paper proposes a summary of CCT contributions on extraordinary experiences and emphasizes the way these works have used the structural/anti-structural coexistence theory to depict the experiences consumers live through. Then it mobilizes a fiction to improve the understanding of escape. This paper highlights how painful leisure pursuits enable consumers to reconnect with their bodies, affording them moments of escape from an otherwise saturated self. The paper shows how the concept of self-escape is important to envision the possibilities in marketing painful experiences."
The influence of media multitasking on advertising effectiveness,"Garaus, Marion",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.244-259","Recent years have seen an increasing trend among consumers toward using two or more media simultaneously, a phenomenon known as media multitasking. The majority of the extant literature agrees that media multitasking has detrimental effects on advertising effectiveness. However, opportunities exist for reducing these negative effects or even creating effects favorable to advertising outcomes. Nevertheless, the literature on media multitasking during advertising exposure is highly fragmented and findings are inconclusive. This literature review synthesizes the extant studies on message processing in media multitasking situations. It develops a comprehensive conceptual framework on the effects of media multitasking on advertising effectiveness, with particular attention to mediating processes and moderating variables. The conceptual model explains the circumstances under which individuals devote voluntary or involuntary attention to advertisements during media multitasking, advances knowledge on the role of different sensory modalities, and reveals how the two types of information processing complement each other during simultaneous media usage."
Rethinking marketing: back to purpose,"Fehrer, Julia A.",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Grand challenges ;  Market shaping ;  Marketing ;  Marketing myopia ;  Social Sciences ;  Systems thinking ;  Value cocreation,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.179-184","Key and colleagues raise some serious criticisms related to the marketing discipline’s purpose drift and short-sighted approach to rigor and relevance. They provide a comprehensive and nuanced picture of the grand challenges in marketing, including the loss of domain expertise, detachment from real-world phenomena, nurturing of methodological monocultures and more generally a perception problem in academia and management practice. This commentary complements their assessment by reviewing strands of literature in the niches and at the edge of mainstream marketing, where we may find some solutions or at least seeds for solutions as a starting point to refine, recalibrate and potentially reshape the future of marketing and marketing research."
Indigenous theory development in marketing: the foundational premises approach,"Hunt, Shelby D.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (1-2), p.8-17","Marketing’s intellectual health requires indigenous theory development. However, marketing is a discipline that, almost exclusively, imports its concepts and theories from other disciplines and applies them to marketing issues. Articles that either
develop
indigenous marketing theory or
use
such theory as a foundation for empirical research are notably absent from marketing journals. A major reason for the absence of indigenous marketing theory is the lack of well-developed procedures and approaches for developing theories and writing conceptual articles. This article proposes, explicates, and illustrates with a concrete example (i.e., service-dominant (S-D) logic) an approach to theory development in marketing that is labeled the “foundational premises, inductive realist approach.” Although this approach is not an algorithmic procedure for theory development, it can provide a valuable conceptual framework for furthering the development of indigenous marketing theory."
A service design approach to healthcare innovation: from decision-making to sense-making and institutional change,"Patrício, Lia ;  Grenha Teixeira, Jorge ;  Vink, Josina",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Decision making ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (1-2), p.115-120","Healthcare is facing complex challenges that demand profound service system innovation. Service design offers an opportunity to move beyond explanatory research and take an action-oriented approach that combines research rigor with relevance to foster innovation in healthcare. We present three research projects that illustrate different ways service design can enable health service system innovation to create uplifting changes in wellbeing. The first research project utilizes a decision-making approach to support design teams in developing value co-creating technology-enabled services for skin cancer prevention. The second project employs a sense-making approach through participatory design to develop a National Electronic Health Record that addresses the multiple and conflicting goals of healthcare network actors. The third project uses an institutional change approach to develop a new digital service for youth with mental health issues while simultaneously shifting the culture of the clinic toward people-centered care through participatory service design. We conclude with research directions to leverage the potential of service design for healthcare innovation, including strengthening the dialogue between explanatory and design research, exploring new multidisciplinary collaborations and integrating multiple research methods."
Multiple stakeholder market orientation: a service-dominant logic perspective of the market orientation paradigm,"Line, Nathaniel D. ;  Runyan, Rodney C. ;  Gonzalez-Padron, Tracy",Business and Management ;  Business ethics ;  Market orientation ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Stakeholders ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (1-2), p.42-60","The purpose of this research is to propose a comprehensive conceptualization of the market orientation construct that acknowledges the role of salient stakeholders in value co-creation. The proposed multiple stakeholder market orientation (MSMO) construct is a more broadly defined conceptualization of what it means to implement the marketing concept in a multi-stakeholder business environment. The construct is developed within the context of prevailing theoretical perspectives including the service-dominant logic of marketing, stakeholder theory, and the market orientation paradigm. Specifically, the construct is developed as an interconnected operant resource consisting of a stakeholder orientation, a systems orientation, and a shared value orientation."
From customer journeys to consumption journeys: a consumer culture approach to investigating value creation in practice-embedded consumption,"Schau, Hope Jensen ;  Akaka, Melissa Archpru",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual ;  Value creation,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.9-22","Prior research on customer journeys chiefly focuses on identifying, from the firm perspective, firm-customer touchpoints. Importantly, the extant literature begins to maps aggregate firm-customer interactions over time to reveal how sequenced firm-controlled touchpoints contribute to customer experience. These customer journey maps tend to emphasize market actions, specifically purchases, over other, customer-centric touchpoints like use occasions, use experiences, storage and disposal. We extend the firm-centric
customer journey
framework to consider customer-centric touchpoints within a broader social and cultural context for value creation. We propose a consumer-centric
consumption journey
which considers consumption within progressive engagement with a practice or set of practices. We offer a culturally grounded consumption journey framework that highlights the importance of practices, communities, and institutions in value creation, and reveals various experiences and value outcomes. Future research regarding consumption journeys can advance understanding of customer experiences and journeys by investigating a variety of sociocultural influences and outcomes of value creation."
The intermingling of meanings in marketing: semiology and phenomenology in consumer culture theory,"Grace, Sarah C.",Business and Management ;  Culture ;  Marketing ;  Phenomenology ;  Semiotics ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.70-80","This paper explores the construction of meaning in consumer culture through a synthesis of two scholarly streams within the Consumer Culture Theory (CCT) body of knowledge: semiology and phenomenology. Semiology represents consumer culture as a web of meanings—studying cultural meanings as socially agreed-upon structures.  By contrast, phenomenology represents the interpretation and personalization of cultural meanings by consumers—focusing on meanings that emerge from individual lived experience. Combining these two approaches results in a framework that excavates meanings at both the cultural level and the individual level, inviting them into a figure-ground relationship. This relationship between levels of analysis illuminates how meaning in consumer culture is constructed, and how cultural meanings come to constitute a sense of normalcy in modern societies. As all marketing activity is culturally situated, understanding meaning in consumer culture provides an alternative way to understand value in marketing."
Market-shaping: navigating multiple theoretical perspectives,"Nenonen, Suvi ;  Storbacka, Kaj",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.336-353","There is an increasing managerial and scholarly interest in the agential efforts of firms, consumers, public actors, and various collectives to influence market formation and transformation. Determining the essence of market-shaping requires an understanding of who is engaged in the shaping, what is being shaped, and how the shaping efforts are performed. To support making more informed choices about which theories to use when examining this phenomenon, we provide an overview of seven theoretical perspectives, illuminating their conceptual underpinnings and relative strengths. Building on this, we discuss how these perspectives can be used to examine market-shaping, highlighting its typical variations. The paper concludes by a call for greater explicitness, compatibility and parsimony when choosing theoretical perspectives for market-shaping research, and by identifying avenues for further research."

To resurrect marketing, we need to fundamentally refocus on marketing in a digital age."
Friendships in marketing: a taxonomy and future research directions,"Banerji, Diptiman ;  Singh, Ramendra ;  Mishra, Prashant",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.223-243","The concept of friendship remains important from societal, academic, and practitioner perspectives. We find that there is a proliferation of research in the marketing discipline on the utilization and applicability of the concept of friendship, but the literature is fragmented. By fragmentation, we refer to the fact that the notion of friendship is tapped in multiple, independent research streams. As a result, there is a lack of an organized and holistic view of friendship-related research in the marketing domain. Drawing on an extensive literature review of 130 papers in more than 30 peer-reviewed scholarly journals across a 37-years time span (1980–2017), this paper synthesizes the extant friendship research in the domain of marketing through a taxonomy, which categorizes the different types of friendship conceptualizations based on two underlying characteristics, or dimensions, the formation of friendship, and consumption timeline. The proposed taxonomy shows the differences as well as the interrelationships between the different publications, giving a systematic view of the research landscape. We suggest future research avenues as well, for further research in the area of marketing-related friendships and highlight why the research is relevant from a real-world perspective."
For re-institutionalizing the marketing discipline in Era V,"Hunt, Shelby D.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.189-198","Commentaries on the status of the marketing discipline conclude that it is significantly troubled, which raises the question: Do the troubles identified portend a de-institutionalization of the discipline in marketing’s Era IV (1980–2020) and its potential re-institutionalization in Era V (2020-?)? This article examines (1) the marketing discipline’s founding in Era I (1900–1920), (2) how the discipline became institutionalized in Era II (1920–1950), (3) how marketing was re-institutionalized in Era III (1950–1980), and (4) how the discipline’s fragmentation in Era IV (1980–2020) portends its de-institutionalization. The article concludes by arguing for the marketing discipline’s re-institutionalization in Era V (2020-?)."
"Markets, infrastructures and infrastructuring markets","Araujo, Luis ;  Mason, Katy",Business and Management ;  Infrastructure ;  Knowledge ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.240-251","Despite a growing understanding of market infrastructures—the rules and socio-material arrangements that enable agreements on the properties of goods, and the calculation of value, equivalence and exchange—we know little of what lies beneath the arrangements that underpin and are implicated in exchange. The socio-material lens has done much to explain how specific assemblages circulate information and goods, but has done little to explain how different infrastructures configure relations between dispersed market practices. Using the history of
the development of the market for market research
we show how
knowledge-based infrastructures
constitute markets as knowledge objects: new expertise emerged through alliances between academia, government, and private actors form a new occupation embodied in specialist agencies that set themselves up in an infrastructural relation to marketing practices. Our conceptualization of markets as knowledge objects extends extant understandings of markets by showing how: (1) extant knowledge-based infrastructures are drawn on to construct new markets; (2) infrastructural relations emerge between different markets to constitute multiple systems of provision and demand, leading to an increasingly valuable knowledge infrastructure; and (3) organized practices in one market are often heavily reliant on connections to other markets, including knowledge-based infrastructures such as market research services."
The unconscious perception of smells as a driver of consumer responses: a framework integrating the emotion-cognition approach to scent marketing,"De Luca, Ramona ;  Botelho, Delane",Business and Management ;  Cognition & reasoning ;  Consumers ;  Marketing ;  Odors ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.145-161","Previous research demonstrates that odors affect consumers’ behavioral, cognitive, and affective responses to products and environments. Sensory and scent research have prioritized an emotional approach in which consumer responses are primarily affective reactions to smells. However, individuals’ perceptions of their environment are frequently regulated by an unconscious mechanism that does not necessarily involve rational thinking. Therefore, their responses to odors may result from automatic and unconscious cognitive processes that occur without their awareness. We propose that the unconscious odor interpretation better regulates consumers’ responses to odors and behaviors than emotions and that the way in which olfactory information is cognitively processed and integrated into knowledge may address the extent to which odors help individuals to perceive their environment holistically and attribute meanings to events and social phenomena. Through a systematic review of 55 empirical studies on olfaction, we i) discuss the current theoretical approaches to scent marketing and the most relevant empirical findings; ii) propose a cognition-based framework to investigate the underlying mechanisms through which odors are mentally processed to influence consumers’ behavioral, cognitive, and affective responses; and iii) develop a research agenda to encourage further studies on the cognitive processing of scents."

Third, I use the agriculture industry to illustrate how an SSR program in marketing could be developed to bring insights to practitioners and policy makers and build new modes of production, consumption and exchange. Finally, I suggest that the SSR program facilitates collaboration between mainstream marketing and CCT researchers by providing a common ontological platform that can transform epistemological differences into complementary strengths. I argue SSR is a way that marketing research can gain broad impact and relevance."
Legendary luxury brands: inventing the future by reaching to the past,"Carpenter, Gregory S. ;  Barlier, Xavier",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.464-470","Unlike many other brands, luxury brands can enjoy remarkably enduring success. This paper presents an interview with a senior executive responsible for marketing Maison Louis Roederer’s champagnes, including the legendary Cristal, in the United States for the last 20 years. We explore the differences between luxury and mass-market brands, the role of creative vision, how brands remain relevant through innovation while remaining faithful to their history, and how luxury brands create passionate buyers who seek to be a part of the brand, not simply consumers of the brand. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for market orientation, understanding consumers as fans, and other future research topics."
Assessing and enhancing the impact potential of marketing articles,"Jaakkola, Elina ;  Vargo, Stephen L.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.407-415","Although the impact of marketing is a recognized priority, current academic practices do not fully support this goal. A research manuscript’s likely influence is difficult to evaluate prior to publication, and audiences differ in their understandings of what “impact” means. This article develops a set of criteria for assessing and enhancing a publication’s impact potential. An article is argued to have greater influence if it changes many stakeholders’ understandings or behaviors on a relevant matter; and makes its message accessible by offering simple and clear findings and translating them into actionable implications. These drivers are operationalized as a checklist of criteria for authors, reviewers, and research supervisors who wish to evaluate and enhance a manuscript’s potential impact. This article invites scholars to further develop and promote these criteria and to participate in establishing impact evaluation as an institutionalized practice within marketing academia."
Markets and institutional fields: foundational concepts and a research agenda,"Mountford, Nicola ;  Geiger, Susi",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.290-303","We borrow the notion of field from institutional theory to think through how markets and their ‘outsides’–or at least one particular manifestation of an ‘outside’–stand in a dynamic and interactive relationship. We distinguish the field and the market in terms of issues versus exchange and identity versus position. We argue that the lack of clarity as to how fields and markets differ, relate, overlap, and are bounded, jeopardizes our ability to address important societal debates concerning the roles of markets within and across other areas of social life. It also hinders a consolidation of insights across different approaches to studying markets, even though researchers from different disciplines often address similar concerns. Key questions for which both conceptual and analytical clarity are essential include how markets and their ‘outsides’ (here: fields) intersect; whether and how diverse sets of actors interact, work, and migrate between fields and markets; and what dynamics may be observable between field and market. We provide four illustrative examples of field/market relationships and a theoretical, methodological, and empirical research agenda for future research into markets and their ‘outsides’."

However, our discipline provides little guidance on how to systematically craft impactful propositions. Consequently, scholars often refrain from including propositions in conceptual articles due to either a lack of knowledge or the confidence to do so. This proves detrimental to scholars looking to develop theory and conceptual papers. To address this challenge, our article defines research propositions and positions them within the broader set of the key building blocks of theory development. Based on an integrative framework that ties foundational premises, concepts, constructs, research propositions and hypothesis together, the article lays out four easy-to-follow actionable steps—grounding, crafting, connecting, and simplifying—that guide scholars in developing effective research propositions. Further, the article proposes four criteria, i.e., clarity, consistency, conciseness, and contribution to theory advancement and scholarly research, to assist scholars in evaluating outcomes achieved when writing research propositions. The article concludes by offering an agenda for how key stakeholders involved, i.e., Ph.D. students, early career researchers and established marketing scholars, university research program directors and promotion and tenure (P&T) committees, as well as reviewers and journal editors, can contribute to advancing knowledge and skills of crafting effective research propositions as part of the broader goal to stimulate the innovation and growth of marketing theories in our discipline."

Thus, the relevance of marketing academics and their work cannot simply be addressed by changing how research is conducted (e.g., more industry engagement), but more foundationally, through a shift in what is researched and how phenomena are studied. By refocusing the discussion from managerial relevance to the relevance of theoretical work in the shaping of markets, we show that both academics and practitioners need to be more cognizant of the market conceptualizations they help to perpetuate. All market actors need to broaden their understanding of markets to incorporate stable as well as dynamic and systemic depictions of markets. Market actors, paradoxically, need to become more theoretical to be more relevant in the shaping of markets."

Yet, the everyday practical and spatial dimensions of market making have received little explicit attention. We thus introduce the concept of spatio-market practices, drawing on key ideas in market studies and spatial theory. We argue that examining spatio-market practices (and thus the spatial dimensions of markets) promises to provide fresh insight regarding what it takes to realise markets, their uneven distribution, and what and whom markets are (and are not) designed to serve. To demonstrate what the concept calls for, supports and promises, we take Humphreys’ (
2010
) influential paper as a starting point and draw on other secondary sources in order to articulate an alternative and spatially-oriented account of the growth and legitimacy of the American casino gambling market. This paper, in turn, contributes a subtle and yet incisive shift in thinking, which supports a more explicit means of exploring markets as spatial formations."

This forward-looking context is used to address issues the marketing discipline is facing to reconcile problems we identify. Academic marketing research has become fragmented and polarized into narrow areas that do not provide holistic contributions to knowledge. Doctoral programs are focusing less on core marketing knowledge and theory and more on methodology. This brings into question the culture of both our doctoral programs and the culture of the discipline to provide high-impact research valuable to practitioners and society, as well as the firm. An agenda for change addresses hiring practices, projects, methods, and oversight on the importance of impact. It is suggested the marketing discipline engage in the study of marketing practice to find important problems to investigate."

However, most academic marketing is developed from normative theories of economics and direct application of psychological and sociological theories. Indigenous marketing theories about markets are rare but can increase the relevance of marketing scholarship. Although theories are never fully finalized, theoretical formalizing processes can establish a general framework for theory development on markets. The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual base for a general theory of markets by explicating the ongoing progression toward formalization of service-dominant (S-D) logic. We outline a recursive, cocreative process of theory formalization to take stock of the status of S-D logic’s development so far—what has been done and what we know and don’t know about markets. We propose specific areas of inquiry and research directions for moving forward in developing a general theory of markets that is indigenous to marketing."

This paper is a first-of-its-kind delve into what the literature is, how it is used, and its impact as a foundation for theory and conceptual work in the discipline of marketing. We create a novel approach that provides a framework to understand the way literature functions in the research process and expose the hidden mechanics of how it creates and ties together various forms of meaning through what we call, citation-based reasoning. It is through this lens that we conclude with insights for how a deeper understanding of the literature can stoke continued impact in the marketing discipline, especially for theory building and conceptual development."

While we concur with the focus of the paper on moving away from a central emphasis on profit maximization, we differ in how we believe this can be achieved. We critique the SET approach put forward from three key positions: (a) the SET approach and the application of virtue ethics; (b) the SET approach and the use of the marketing mix to operationalize it in practice; and, (c) the missing systemic and institutional barriers which we believe render SET problematic both theoretically and in practical terms. We conclude by suggesting that instead of utilising normative ethical theories to address socio-ecological challenges marketing researchers turn to other perspectives, such as ecofeminism."

Looking at the affordances of text and textuality, I consider the ways that text orients the social practices critical to market exchange through its archival and public nature."

C.",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.140-144","This commentary addresses the Social and Ecological Thought (SET) framework based on virtue ethics (Dyck & Manchanda, in

). The basis of this framework is to replace utilitarian values that focus on profit maximization. The Financial Bottom Line (FBL) is believed to be a mainstream utilitarian philosophy. In addition, the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) is considered inadequate to address socio-ecological issues because there is a major focus on financial performance. After addressing some of the limitations in the SET framework, the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework is presented as a more relevant alternative. ESG provides a lens for creating priorities for socio-ecological comparative performance based on industry, investors’ and peer index scores. There is a strong correlation between ESG performance and profits. Compelling evidence is provided that suggests there is no conflict between socio-ecological responsibility and financial success."

Through the evidence-based synthesis of qualitative data, we extract 20 generalized market-shaping activities that inform and form the foundation of a three-phased market-shaping process. This conceptual framework divides the market-shaping process into the phases of infusion, formation and retention. By applying our conceptual framework to the qualitative dataset, we explore the presence of market-shaping phases and provide further insights into the interdependences and dynamics between multiple, simultaneously occurring, market-shaping processes. By providing a structured market-shaping process, we attempt to reduce the overall complexity of the market-shaping phenomenon and facilitate the operationalization of the phenomenon for further market-shaping research. Additionally, our conceptualization provides practitioners with a framework to analyze the market-shaping efforts of other market actors and support the design of their own market-shaping strategies."
The instantaneous commitment effect: developing stakeholder orientation among managers,"Vaid, Shashank ;  Ahearne, Michael",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.162-179","The authors introduce and investigate incoming managers’ instantaneous commitment - a novel concept increasingly relevant to frontline managers. Instantaneous commitment is a type of organizational commitment that can be formed expediently on the back of incoming managers’ preexisting role/work-related factors (stakeholder connections, relationships, and skills) offering organizations guidance on managers’ stakeholder orientation. Moreover, instantaneous commitment helps organizations avoid the classic loyalty-utility dilemma, as it provides an organization-wide instantaneous approach towards better stakeholder focus while being agnostic to emotional investment (loyalty) and to calculative assessment (utility) that may take shape over time. The authors provide a parsimonious explanation of instantaneous commitment construct and differentiate it from related constructs (affective commitment and continuance commitment). We also offer an understanding of how organizations can engender instantaneous commitment among managers. Finally, we develop a conceptual framework of a set of factors - prior role/work related antecedents, stakeholder orientation consequence of instantaneous commitment, and moderating influences of individual, environmental and new role/work related factors."

Field theory can help us understand why some innovations are more piecemeal and others more revolutionary. It explicitly links innovation to the process of the emergence, adjustment, and transformation of markets (conceived of as fields). To illustrate this perspective, the case of the transition in the U.S. from a mortgage market dominated by savings and loan banks to the emergence of mortgage securitization dominated by the government sponsored enterprises and the largest private banks, is explicated. Field theory helps us understand the logic of this transition and the myriad players and innovations that helped produce a large part of what we consider to be modern finance. The case also shows the limits of economic theories of financial innovation and the sociology of finance. I end with a discussion of how field theory can inform subsequent research on innovation."

Mapping spheres of exchange: a multidimensional approach to commoditization and singularization,"Brondino-Pompeo, Karin",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.81-95","The process of commoditization–singularization, as developed by Kopytoff, is a compelling concept for understanding market exchange, and has been explored predominantly by scholars of consumer culture theoretics. The concept allows us to examine complex interactions between people, objects, and the dynamics of a market, and the literature based on it has illuminated the intricate tensions and contradictions within and between spheres of exchange. The use of the concept, however, is not without problems since some studies have applied dualistic or simplistic versions of it. This paper illustrates the current state of affairs by revisiting Kopytoff’s seminal work and analyzing the marketing and consumer research literature that derives from it, thus demonstrating how the conceptualization has evolved over time. In an attempt to overcome the dualist approach and further explore this topic, I propose a multidimensional perspective of spheres of exchange, offering an alternative approach for investigating the commoditization–singularization process."

In the past decade, extensive research in the field of online reviews has focused on product categories (e.g., hedonic, utilitarian) and product sales. However, research on how the characteristics of online reviews (valence, volume, and variance) influence attitudes toward brands is sparse, even though brands are among the most valuable corporate assets and companies use online marketing extensively to increase brand loyalty. Thus, this paper offers a conceptual model that closely examines the relationship between the characteristics of online reviews and brand attitudes. The model contributes to a better understanding of the influence of contextual factors on brand attitudes within online communication. In line with prior research, the study conceptualizes volume and variance as moderators of valence. Furthermore, the proposed conceptual model integrates brand type (functional, emotional, symbolic, and lifestyle) and the source of review (stranger or acquaintance) as potential moderators. Conceptual insights, along with managerial implications for online marketing managers, are provided."

A framework for viral marketing replication and mutation,"Fox, Gavin L. ;  Lind, Stephen J.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.206-222","The value of successful viral marketing campaigns to marketing performance is widely acknowledged. As a result, a great deal of attention is paid to mechanisms that foster viral spread. However, due to the consumer-influenced nature of viral replication, it is also important to consider the malleability of such messages. Expanding the focus to include the potential for viral mutations is a critical step in understanding how viral messages evolve and in understanding which messages are most likely to spread and generate their desired impact. Further, there currently is no accepted model for the viral marketing replication process to guide research efforts. Therefore, this article defines viral message mutations, builds a framework for the viral replication process, and identifies susceptibility to mutation at various stages of that process. The proposed framework is then used to offer numerous avenues for future research."

When they do, and when the brand is prominent in their minds, they become psychologically attached to the brand, and display strong brand loyalty and advocacy behaviors. We use a grounded theory framework to ask if
employees
develop similar brand-self connections and regard the brand as prominent in their lives based on the meaning they attach to the brand they work for. This question is important because employee’s attachment to the brand can have critical equity-driving implications for the brand’s marketplace success and the employee’s commitment to the organization. We also ask what drives such outcomes. Beyond identifying novel drivers of employees’ brand attachment, we find that employees’ attachment to a brand is conceptually and empirically different from attachment or commitment to the organization. Specifically, we observe employees who are not attached to the organization but who are still attached to the brand, and who engage in difficult-to-enact pro-brand and pro-organization behaviors. Finally, our findings contribute to a broader knowledge base on organizational commitment and attachment by identifying brand meaning-related drivers of employees’ organizational commitment/attachment. Prior research has studied non-brand related drivers of these organizational outcomes."

LMC are defined here as brand building strategies that pair a brand with another object for the purpose of enabling the brand to benefit from the associations the target audience has with the object. We develop an integrative conceptual framework for understanding the factors that influence the brand effects of LMC that is informed by prior research findings on five different LMC strategies (celebrity endorsement, sponsorship, product placements, cause-related marketing, and cobranding) and their effects on the brand. The framework also draws on prior models of cobranding and Keller’s (
1993
) customer-based brand equity concept and it addresses weaknesses in previous LMC frameworks. The integrated framework contributes to the literature by allowing for an understanding of both when, and how, associations transfer from the branded object to the brand in the context of LMC. Specifically, the framework proposes that learning of brand awareness and transfer of associations from the LMC object to the brand take place via four different routes and that a broad range of brand-, object-, and campaign-related variables moderate these brand awareness and transfer effects. Managerial recommendations and an agenda for future research are offered."

This article proposes a parsimonious organizing framework for marketing strategy decisions and the tools associated with each decision. This framework is grounded in four assumptions or first principles that guide the effectiveness of any marketing strategy: (1) All customers differ, (2) all customers change, (3) all competitors react, and (4) all resources are limited. By reviewing prior marketing research through the lens of these four principles, this article illustrates how marketing theory and practice can apply extant analyses and frameworks to support strategy decisions associated with each principle.

Therefore, it is imperative that doctoral programs place theory at the heart of curriculum that shapes the thinking, priorities, and research efforts of our new scholars. Unfortunately, in many doctoral programs, this does not happen. To spur a conversation on this critically important issue in our discipline, I suggest five initiatives that seek to reimagine the content and structure of marketing doctoral programs. These initiatives are: (1) Add marketing to marketing doctoral programs; (2) Create a dedicated space in the curriculum for theory construction; (3) Restructure the sequence of doctoral seminars; (4) Make a foundational essay mandatory in dissertations; and (5) Change the culture of marketing doctoral programs."

Sustainability in marketing: a systematic review unifying 20 years of theoretical and substantive contributions (1997–2016),"Lunde, Matthew B.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Sustainability ;  Systematic review ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (3-4), p.85-110","A growing area of marketing research has surfaced in the past 20 years at the nexus of marketing and sustainability. However, a review of marketing literature shows that this field lacks conceptual and theoretical clarity. This article reviews research published on sustainability from 25 leading marketing journals between 1997 and 2016. It examines how theories used to frame sustainability in marketing literature have evolved. Additionally, no unified definition for sustainability exists in current marketing literature. To fill this void, the author proposes a new, holistic definition of sustainability in marketing, coined “sustainable marketing,” which is unique to the marketing discipline. Through presenting the GREEN Framework of Sustainable Marketing, the author conceptually and theoretically clarifies, unifies, and extends the current research. Finally, the systematic review explores implications for theory and practice and offers researchers, practitioners, and policymakers many opportunities for future research."
On the practical relevance of the attraction effect: A cautionary note and guidelines for context effect experiments,"Lichters, Marcel ;  Sarstedt, Marko ;  Vogt, Bodo",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2015, Vol.5 (1-2), p.1-19","While the attraction effect has received considerable attention in consumer research, recent research concludes that the effect is restricted to artificial choice settings, which questions its relevance for marketing practice. This paper takes a broader perspective on the issue of the generalizability of research results and introduces a set of background factors, which, if neglected, have adverse consequences for such generalizability. The results of our extensive review of the literature on this topic, published during the last four decades in the top 30 marketing journals, show that context effect studies have routinely neglected these background factors. In light of our results, we propose guidelines for implementing context effect experiments in future consumer research. These guidelines allow for a more realistic analysis of the attraction effect and related context effects in consumer research."

Advancing marketing theory encompasses developing organic marketing theories, refining and extending theories developed in other disciplines used to explain and predict marketing phenomena, evaluating theories currently in vogue in the field and discarding flawed theories, and developing overarching theories that in addition to explaining marketing phenomena also explain a broader range of phenomena that transcend disciplinary boundaries. Along the lines of the demonstrated potential of theories developed in other disciplines to shed light into marketing phenomena, the potential of organic marketing theories to shed light into phenomena that are the focus of research in other disciplines also merit exploration. Against this backdrop, drawing on theory insights from marketing literature and other disciplines, this commentary focuses on issues relating to development of new theories, extensions and revisions of theories in vogue, and discarding of flawed theories."

This research takes a fresh look at these concepts that some academics regard as causing an identity crisis in marketing. Historical analysis reveals many practical applications, which arise from the broadening/generic paradigm, result in unresolvable theoretical anomalies. Consequently, a new paradigm is proposed. Marketing systems, we argue, provides a logically coherent foundation for building a general theory of marketing."

With increased transparency of employees’ pay outcomes stemming from CRM and related technologies, salespeople now have ample opportunity to observe these inequalities, compare their pay with that of others, and make fairness assessments. These comparisons and assessments then have implications in terms of utility, behaviors, and performance of salespeople, which have scarcely been explored in the sales or marketing literature. This article considers research on pay inequality from three other fields – economics, management, and psychology – and highlights relevant issues in sales contexts. Furthermore, the article provides scholars with a resource that elaborates on the nature of pay inequalities and their multiple outcomes on individual and organizational performance, as well as noting their likely antecedents and moderators."

Review, live and die by their ability to obtain high quality reviews of submitted manuscripts. However, academics are increasingly pressed for time, needing to publish their research, teach their classes, and provide service to their Department, Faculty/College and University to support their careers in terms of retention, tenure, and promotion. Amidst these responsibilities, as a service to the Academy, academics also are expected to provide reviews of manuscripts in order to move the intellectual trajectory of the domain forward. High quality reviewing, though, takes cognitive energy and is time consuming, which then interferes with other academic responsibilities. For these reasons, editors of peer-reviewed academic journals are finding it more and more difficult to obtain a sufficient number of high-quality reviews to make good decisions about submissions in a timely manner. The purpose of this article is to help
all
reviewers, but especially those reviewing conceptual articles, provide a high-quality review. Specifically, this article first defines what constitutes a “high quality review,” and suggests how reviewing can aid an academic’s own research, writing and career. It then defines the behaviors needed for effective reviewing for all manuscripts, termed the 5 R’s: roles, responsibilities, responses, reactions, and respect. It then provides a reviewing template for conceptual articles, given the special difficulties of peer reviewing such articles, and closes with a few additional pieces of advice to help with being efficient in reviewing, while being effective."

Such offerings have upended business processes by being less costly for firms to produce, store, and distribute. The ways in which consumers access them and interact with them have called into question traditional notions of ownership, access and control. This paper extends the thinking about digital offerings by proposing a Digital Continuum framework: a conceptual model anchored at one end by Digital Products and at the other by Digital Services. We discuss the benefits and costs that accrue to both consumers and firms along the Continuum that result from differences in ownership, access, control and customization/cocreation."

How do they know whether a product or service is priced reasonably, is a good deal or is too expensive? Do buyers perceive all price increases and all price promotions? Do price promotions and price increases necessarily change buyer behavior? How do buyers process the plethora of price information they encounter each day? Economists contend that price primarily represents the monetary sacrifice to obtain a product or service. Behavioral price researchers argue that more complex phenomena are involved. Buyers have individual, internal norms against which they judge prices. There are threshold points below which buyers do not perceive price changes. There are also specific ranges of prices buyers find acceptable for a particular product. Despite over four decades of behavioral price research, we know little about the root causes of these buyer responses to price information. This article is the first of several planned essays that will review the historical, theoretical and empirical developments in the field of behavioral price research. In this first review, we examine the core concepts behind buyer responses to price as well as the complex way that people process numbers. The objective of these essays is to bring focus to, clarify conceptual definitions, examine empirical developments and raise future research questions for this field of study."

Many must learn to live with one or more diseases throughout their lives. Healthcare service must therefore support, to a greater extent, individuals living with illness. An important part of this transition is to improve the use of patients’ knowledge and resources to organize treatment in accordance with their own needs and values. Patient-centered healthcare can provide better patient experiences, better professional quality, and the possibility of slowing down resource consumption. Therefore, patient-centered initiatives have taken center stage in discussions on how to improve quality in healthcare service as discussed by Berry (2019) in this issue of the AMS Review. A cornerstone of patient-centered care is shared decision making, where healthcare professionals and patients work together to reach a shared healthcare choice."

Building on a multidisciplinary approach and a review of power models, we begin with a conceptualization of empowerment, identifying the concept’s contours and origins. Then, we show how multidisciplinary advancements influence the marketing discipline through an assessment of the empowerment literature. We reveal important knowledge gaps on the topic related to different theoretical orientations and various levels of analysis and context. We then propose an organizing framework to help understand the underlying mechanisms induced in psychological empowerment by changes in the market structure and technological shifts, consumer-to-firm, state-to-consumer, and firm-to-consumer deliberate actions. Our critical review of the marketing literature reveals the limits of prior research, and we suggest directions for future theoretical and empirical research on the consumer empowerment theme."

Objective time is straightforward, and refers to clock time. In contrast, subjective time is quite nuanced and refers to the differential experience and perception of time. Recognizing this distinction, a number of scholars have suggested that the marketing discipline relies upon objective time, and as a result, does not have a fully developed understanding of time. Conducting a historical assessment of time, we demonstrate that marketing has a conceptually-bounded view of time. We develop a conceptual framework that reconceptualizes time as objective and subjective and as experienced by multiple referents, and develop research propositions that highlight the importance of integrating a broadened view of time into marketing research, recognizing that we are better off thinking about time as objective time and subjective time. We conclude with a discussion highlighting future research opportunities."

In particular, unwanted hospitalizations increase in number and duration, a pattern of overtreatment that not only violates patient choice but also constitutes preventable medical waste. Existing services that align care with patient preference are underused, in part because both physicians and patients associate them with dying and denial of treatment. An innovative program developed at Sutter Health, a large integrated system in Northern California, illustrates how to remedy this situation. Nurse-led teams bring care to the residences of more than 2000 patients with advanced illness each day, increasing the quality of their care, reducing hospitalizations and lowering costs. Program branding and messaging has led to widespread acceptance, and the initiative has become a foundational component of a new Medicare payment model. Skillful branding and messaging of service innovation initiatives can help to overcome the emotional and attitudinal barriers restricting the use of current service lines, changing the focus of care for seriously-ill people from the hospital to their homes."

Marketing to the poor: an institutional model of exchange in emerging markets,"Prabhu, Jaideep ;  Tracey, Paul ;  Hassan, Magda",Business and Management ;  Business models ;  Emerging markets ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2017, Vol.7 (3-4), p.101-122","In this paper we argue that formal exchanges with poor consumers in emerging markets are hard to create and maintain, resulting in widespread market failure. More specifically, in emerging markets the institutions required for exchange either function poorly or are entirely absent, making it difficult for sellers to deliver affordable and accessible offerings to poor buyers in a financially sustainable manner. The marketing challenge thus becomes (1) developing a viable business model to facilitate market-based exchanges and (2) shaping the institutions needed to implement this business model. Drawing on institutional theory and extending it with insights from the marketing and business model innovation literatures, we develop a model of exchange in emerging markets. At the heart of our model is the idea that sellers often need to act as institutional entrepreneurs in order to create and deliver value when marketing to the poor in emerging markets. We discuss the implications of our model for future research on marketing, exchange and emerging economies, as well as the implications for managers seeking to market to the poor in emerging economies."

To maximize and coordinate their access to this diverse knowledge, some incumbents have developed innovation platforms whereby new ventures and smaller companies contribute their discoveries and innovations. These platforms allow incumbents to shape and control their ecosystems. These ecosystems have been fertile grounds for the creation of new ventures of different types. In this article, we explore the role of innovation ecosystems in birthing and supporting new ventures and inducing heterogeneity among them; discuss how these ventures’ entrepreneurial activities within these innovation ecosystems are likely to vary from those in other contexts; and consider the implications of such ecosystems for the strategic shifts that new ventures might experience in the course of their evolution.

And while all embody theoretical advancements in marketing describing situations where firms and customers collaborate in the co-creation of value, heretofore they have received limited exploration in fundamental models of pricing. Seeking to fill this gap, we delve into the co-creation literature in search of conceptual building blocks. From a detailed review, we identify six distinct mechanisms underlying value created by customers but absent from existing pricing models. In the course of their co-creative interactions with firms, customers can provide knowledge, innovation, attention, effort, quality and additional revenue to firms. We proceed to construct a model of price determination which incorporates elements of co-creative value from customers and elaborate real world applications of the model. The conceptual and practical implications of incorporating co-creation into pricing are far-reaching and we offer directions for both audiences."

A key catalyst for innovation—acknowledged by managers as well as academics—is input from customers. However, the functional aspect of customer input in the process of business model innovation (BMI) is still ambiguous. In this paper, we explore the role of customers in the process of BMI and propose a conceptual model that links customer input to BMI success. Particularly, our model demonstrates how customer input is generated and how organizations can efficiently and effectively manage such input to enhance the performance of their newly innovated BM. This proposed model provides managers with a basis for developing actionable plans to reach customers, utilize their input during the BMI process, and enhance BMI success."

Benign envy,"Belk, Russell",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2011, Vol.1 (3-4), p.117-134","Envy has long been held to be a harmful emotion involving the desire to deprive others of the qualities or possessions that they possess and we covet. When the various religious injunctions against such malicious envy were conceived, the consumption landscape was vastly different. There was no branding, advertising, mass media, consumer credit, or Internet; neighbors knew neighbors; social hierarchies were relatively fixed; and discretionary income was largely unknown. This conceptual synthesis suggests that contemporary consumption is driven far more by benign envy involving a desire to “level up” through consumption emulation rather than “level down” by harming others. The concept of benign envy is developed along with an analysis of the forces leading to its displacement of malicious envy and its key role as a motivator of consumption. The paper concludes with a theoretical development of forms of envy and being envied and derives implications for theory and research."

Toward an improved conceptual understanding of consumer ambivalence,"Sipilä, Jenni ;  Tarkiainen, Anssi ;  Sundqvist, Sanna",Business and Management ;  Consumption ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (3-4), p.147-162","Despite the significance of ambivalence in consumer research, the concept suffers from a lack of clarity. This study thus aims to develop an improved conceptual understanding of consumer ambivalence based on the analysis of existing definitions. A number of challenges are observed and addressed through key premises that characterize the concept of consumer ambivalence. Furthermore, the presented conceptualization is contextualized into the area of consumption. The result of this process is an enhanced view of consumer ambivalence that builds on and extends earlier conceptualizations in 1) recognizing a wide variety of concepts that can be studied under the umbrella of consumer ambivalence, 2) specifying the multitude of objects of consumer ambivalence, and 3) specifying the temporal scope of consumer ambivalence through the concept of consumption episodes. The proposed conceptualization accommodates the richness of different approaches to consumer ambivalence and thus contributes to a wide range of consumer research."

Managers use the term “Big Data” to describe this avalanche of information, which many view as critical to providing a better understanding of customers and markets. This research uses interviews with managers to examine the marketing function’s perspective on data-driven decision making within the firm. Based on informant responses, we develop a hierarchy of data-oriented decision making, describe the drivers that influence where a firm falls within this hierarchy, and detail several transition capabilities for marketing managers interested in becoming more data-driven. The key factors that influence the level of data driven decision making are: 1) firm environment; 2), competition, 3) executive commitment, 4) interdepartmental dynamics, and 5) organizational structure. This framework guides marketing managers both in evaluating the firm’s data capabilities and facilitating change."
Global new product development: moderating role of national culture on the link between buyer–seller interactions and innovation outcomes,"Sivakumar, K. ;  Roy, Subroto",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Product development ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (3-4), p.205-229","The emergence of varying perspectives on globalization has meant that buyer-seller interactions in the context of new product development (NPD) are becoming culturally more nuanced. Important research findings exist on the factors influencing the various stages of the NPD process, the role of buyer-seller interactions on NPD, and the role of national culture on NPD. What happens when global NPD occurs between buyers and sellers in different cultures? Does the type of interaction and the stage of NPD matter? How can buyers leverage NPD success globally using the dimensions of national culture? Extant research does not offer a conceptual framework to examine the moderating role of national culture differences on the link between buyer-seller interactions and different stages of NPD. Such a framework is important to expand our knowledge of the NPD process in the increasingly global environment and to offer meaningful guidance to executives when managing the NPD process cross culturally. Our research sheds light on these important questions at the intersection of NPD, national culture, and buyer-seller interactions. In doing so, we differentiate between the initiation and implementation stages of NPD and distinguish between variety and intensity of interactions. We then consider the moderating role of six national cultural dimensions (individualism, power distance, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence). Important implications of our work for research and managerial practice are highlighted."
"The extended self, product valuation, and the endowment effect","Villanova, Daniel",Business and Management ;  Consumer behavior ;  Consumer goods ;  Endowment ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual ;  Valuation,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (3-4), p.357-371","Various explanations have been proposed to account for discrepancies in product valuation, pertaining particularly to the buyer-seller valuation gap called the endowment effect. Previous research has examined the roles of loss sensitivity, strategic responding, differences between buyers and sellers in information processing, self-enhancement, and psychological ownership as causes of the endowment effect. This article presents a conceptual perspective based on the theory of the extended self that integrates previously proposed mechanisms for the endowment effect. The self-extension perspective generates novel predictions about possible moderators of the endowment effect. Further, the self-extension perspective also raises questions for product valuation in general. By integrating previous research and posing new questions, the self-extension perspective provides a new base for the advancement of research on product valuation."
Frontline knowledge networks in open collaboration models for service innovations,"Ozkok, Ozlem ;  Bell, Simon J. ;  Singh, Jagdip ;  Lim, Kwanghui",Business and Management ;  Innovations ;  Knowledge ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Taxonomy ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (3-4), p.268-288","Service organizations often view customer-facing or frontline employees (FLEs) as sources of inimitable knowledge valuable for innovation. This is due to the experiential nature of service and subtle qualities of engaging customer interactions. Yet, organizations face significant challenges while leveraging the knowledge of their FLEs to develop service innovations. Drawing upon the open innovation and social network literatures, we theorize the role of FLE networks, and the degree to which these networks enable the flow of distinct content for realizing effective service innovation. Specifically, we conceptualize a taxonomy of network
domains
—connecting customer- and internal-facing employees, and resource
flows
—new knowledge and self-governance activities, to provide a framework for FLE roles in knowledge networks for service-innovation. Our taxonomy expands opportunities for theorizing the mechanisms of frontline knowledge networks in service innovation as well as identifying a “dark side” that undermines potential innovation gains if left unchecked. Future directions and implications for theory and practice are discussed."
Business model innovation: a marketing ecosystem view,"Robertson, Thomas S.",Business and Management ;  Business models ;  Ecosystems ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2017, Vol.7 (3-4), p.90-100","Innovation in marketing has focused on products and services and paid scant attention to business models. Yet there is an argument that business model innovation can sometimes have greater long run success than product innovation and that it is harder for competitors to emulate. In this review we examine the extant literature on business model innovation—primarily in adjacent academic fields—and suggest that marketing variables and methods play an essential role in conceptualizing the field. In order to stimulate further thinking in marketing, we propose an ecosystem of business model innovation and offer a set of research questions."

Understanding market-based value creation in the field of marketing has centered, to a large degree, on market orientation studies via field-based, discovery-oriented research. In some ways, market orientation – while viewed as the implementation of the marketing concept – became a disruptive marketing strategy for many organizations. That is, marketing started to permeate all aspects of an organization, and even became a boundary-spanning phenomenon connecting multiple companies. The activities in marketing moved beyond their traditional home department and the marketing function became cross-departmental and even, in some cases, cross-company focused. Where do we go next? Disruptive marketing strategy will help the field and practice of marketing evolve."

Market orientation − firm performance link in a dynamic environment: looking inside the black box,"Sett, Rahul Kumar",Business and Management ;  Market orientation ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (3-4), p.163-179","Our understanding of how market orientation can sustain superior firm performance in a rapidly changing environment is still evolving. This paper presents a model that explains the phenomenon by viewing market orientation as a firm-level dynamic capability that comprises three component capacities: to
sense
opportunities and threats; to
seize
opportunities and/or guard against threats; and to
reconfigure
firm resources in sync with environmental changes. These three capacities represent the three dimensions of market orientation. The nature of these capacities and the organizational processes that undergird them are explicated. It is argued that the capacities of sensing, seizing, and resource reconfiguration can help a market oriented firm to advantageously exploit environmental uncertainties and thereby sustain superior performance. Direction of future research and managerial implications are discussed."

Firm authenticity is distinguished from trustworthiness, corporate social responsibility, and market orientation, providing insight into the strategy’s theoretical boundaries. Drawing on signaling and stakeholder theories, a mediated conceptual model capturing a series of research propositions is advanced. Signaling theory suggests that signaling authenticity can be effective, and stakeholder theory proposes that firm authenticity appeals to all stakeholders, resulting in increased shareholder value and potentially shielding the firm from negative consumer reactions, whereas signaling theory proposes that it positively influences consumer related outcome variables (loyalty and purchase intentions). Managers are encouraged to integrate authenticity into their organizations, while research extensions that operationalize the construct and test its nomological validity, using latent variable modeling, secondary data analysis, or a combination thereof are recommended."

Hence, metaphors can satisfy important requirements of marketing communications. Accordingly, in recent decades, an increasing amount of marketing research has examined this concept. The present article provides an overview of this research on metaphors in the advertising literature, outlines the importance of metaphoric advertising for achieving key marketing aims, and identifies crucial research gaps in the current literature. Based on this overview, we integrate theoretical ideas and empirical findings from marketing and (consumer) psychology to develop the Metaphoric Advertising Processing Model (MAP), which offers new insights into the definition, processing, comprehension, and outcomes of metaphoric advertising. We conclude with concrete suggestions and recommendations for future research and describe the practical implications of the model."
Beyond the expected benefits: unpacking value co-creation in crowdsourcing business models,"Fedorenko, Ivan ;  Berthon, Pierre",Business and Management ;  Business models ;  Crowdsourcing ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2017, Vol.7 (3-4), p.183-194","This paper explores how value is co-created in crowdsourcing business models. We envision crowd contributors as a special kind of non-consumer multi-role stakeholder. Our model suggests that the value they derive from monetary rewards and other expected benefits of participation is mediated by experiential value and identity value. The latter is driven by contributors’ identification with a crowdsourcing platform as a virtual ‘space’ for co-creation, and by the peer identification with other contributors. Both experiential and identity value creation are positively impacted by perceived control, which reflects contributors’ perception of co-creation governance and fosters identification."
Knowledge management capabilities of lead firms in innovation ecosystems,"Velu, Chander",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2015, Vol.5 (3-4), p.123-141","Knowledge management is a key capability for innovation. Prior research has typically conceptualized and examined knowledge management capabilities as a property of an individual firm or business unit. More recently, however, the locus of competition and innovation has started to shift from the individual firm to firms working together as an ecosystem. In light of these changing realities, we explicate a set of capabilities that are built, maintained, and exercised by the lead firm in order to enhance innovation within ecosystems. We highlight three knowledge management capabilities: (1) knowledge acquisition, (2) knowledge sharing, and (3) knowledge utilization. Drawing on open and closed action strategies firms use to foster team-based innovation, we develop propositions for the knowledge management capabilities of the lead firm. Our approach highlights three salient tensions that arise from team based innovation: autonomy–control, dissent–consent and uncertainty–certainty. We highlight how the three tensions need to be managed across knowledge management capabilities in order to increase the rate of innovation of the ecosystem. In doing so, we contribute to the evolving marketing literature on sensing and responding in ecosystems in order to provide customers with superior value. We discuss the implications for both managers and theory."
"Proposal, project, practice, pause: Developing a framework for evaluating smart domestic product engagement","Woodall, Tony ;  Rosborough, Julie ;  Harvey, John",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (1-2), p.58-74","Smart homes are fast becoming a reality, with smart TVs, smart meters and other such “smart” devices/systems already representing a substantial household presence. These, which we collectively term “smart domestic products” (SDPs), will need to be promoted, adopted, and normalized into daily routines. Despite this, the marketing canon lacks a substantive discourse on pertinent research. We look to help correct this by melding ideas from organizational sociology, innovation diffusion and appropriation studies, and service dominant logic. Consequently, we suggest a framework for research that responds directly to the specific characteristics of SDPs. Using the SDP eco-system as a context, our framework emphasizes the interplay of embeddedness, practice, value and engagement. It comprises a four-stage horizontal/longitudinal axis we describe as proposal, project, practice and pause. Cross-sectionally we focus on value, and combine aspects of existing thought to suggest how this impacts each stage of our engagement continuum. We subsequently identify perceived personal advantage as the resultant of these two axes and propose this as the key for understanding consumer and SDP sociomaterial engagement. This article also advances a definition of SDPs and ends with an agenda for further research."
Why broadened marketing has enriched marketing,"Kotler, Philip",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Marketing ;  Nonprofit organizations ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (1-2), p.20-22","The marketing discipline, which emerged in the early 1900s, spent its first 70 years focused on describing and evaluating how for-profit organizations conduct their commercial operations with products and services. Starting in the 1970s, marketing scholars – Philip Kotler, Sidney Levy, Gerald Zaltman, and Richard Bagozzi – wrote a series of articles showing that marketing activities go on in the non-profit sector as well. They proposed that the marketing discipline would be enriched by working with the “marketing” problems of non-profit and public organizations--not just the marketing problems of commercial organizations. This subsequently came to be known as the “broadening of marketing.” A few years later, some marketers challenged the broadening idea as not belonging in the discipline of marketing. The broadening scholars suggested carrying out a referendum with marketing professors. The subsequent vote proved to be overwhelmingly in favor of the broadening movement. More recently, Adel El-Ansary and co-authors (El-Ansary et al.
AMS Review,
2018
) raised the question of whether the broadening work is part of a larger paradigm that might lead to a general theory of marketing."

Over the years, research on retail design and atmospherics has been almost completely focused on store interiors. This research shortfall is unfortunate given the increasing focus of savvy retail managers on brand building and the creation of sustainable competitive advantage through exterior store architecture, outdoor lifestyle centers, and urban shopping districts. In order to stimulate research in this important, yet under-researched topic area, we synthesize literature from a number of domains and provide a conceptual framework that examines the impact of outdoor atmospherics on shoppers’ psychological and behavioral responses. After presentation of this framework, we discuss implications for practice and potential avenues for future research."

Consumer cooperatives: uncovering the value potential of customer ownership,"Talonen, Antti ;  Jussila, Iiro ;  Saarijärvi, Hannu ;  Rintamäki, Timo",Business and Management ;  Direct selling ;  Loyalty ;  Market strategy ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2016, Vol.6 (3-4), p.142-156","The consumer cooperative enterprise is becoming an increasingly noteworthy company form. Various forms of sharing economy and recent initiatives in collaborative consumption further amplify the relevance of a company form wherein the members have a dual role, acting both as owners and as customers. Today, cooperatives that are based on customer ownership can be found in banking, insurance, and retailing, where they account for about a trillion US dollars in annual revenue. Notwithstanding the relevance of cooperatives and their unique characteristics, which are partly contradictory within the framework of investor-owned firms, this company form and customer ownership itself have remained under-explored in consumer marketing research. Customer ownership may hold major implications for how customers ultimately perceive value, which, in turn, influences the very foundations for companies’ competitiveness: customer satisfaction, repurchase intention, and recommendation. Consequently, the purpose of this conceptual study is to uncover the value potential of customer ownership. As a result, a conceptual framework that addresses the value potential of customer ownership is proposed. In addition, the work identifies what kind of value customers can perceive through customer ownership and how that value can be defined and created in consumer cooperatives. The paper concludes with a discussion of both theoretical and managerial implications emerging from the value potential of customer ownership."

Three systems underpinning marketing behavior,"Bagozzi, Richard P.",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (1-2), p.23-29","The new marketing systems paradigm proposed by El-Ansary, Shaw, and Lazer in their thoughtful AMS Review Article is taken to heart herein by reframing disparate pieces of scholarship and emerging research in the field through a systems lens. Three systems are proposed to undergird marketing theories, thought, and behavior: (1) a purposive-driven, goal-directed behavior systems point of view that the actors contemplating, entering, engaging, and resolving marketing exchanges undergo, (2) biological systems (neuroscience, endocrinological, and genetic) grounding marketing exchanges, and (3) cooperative and competitive systems in which goal-directed behavior and biological systems are realized in an integrative way. It is straining, however, to characterize the state of the field as constituting an identity crisis in my opinion, because the majority of marketing scholars, practitioners, and students do not appear to be concerned with or even aware of such a crisis in that the history of marketing thought does not interest them. Perhaps once the field moves from descriptive frameworks to testable theories, and experiences an integration of ideas potentially building towards more comprehensive theories in marketing, we will see hope for a general theory of marketing."

Its essential process dimension, however, remains surprisingly under-theorized.

This framework distinguishes four ideal-typical models of the relationship marketing process: (1) life-cycle, (2) evolutionary, (3) teleological and (4) dialectical process models. Our review of the relationship marketing literature reveals the prevalence of life-cycle conceptions of the relationship marketing process, followed by teleological and evolutionary conceptions. It is against this backdrop that we illustrate the value of dialectical process models as a first promising opportunity to advance relationship marketing theory. The second opportunity we showcase consists in combining two (or more) of these process models. We end with guidelines on how to identify suitable combinations of commensurable process models to systematize the multifaceted opportunities for advancing theory in relationship marketing and beyond."

Furthermore, the works have shown how resource-advantage (R-A) theory (5) grounds major theories of marketing strategy, (6) illuminates, informs, extends, and grounds the field's foundational premises, (7) identifies three fundamental strategies (""superior value,"" ""lower cost,"" and ""synchronal""), and (8) explains how the three fundamental strategies promote societal welfare. However, a major unresolved issue concerns the second fundamental explanandum of strategic marketing. Specifically, Varadarajan (AMS Review, 5, 78-90, 2015) expands his second fundamental explanandum from ""marketplace and financial performance"" to explaining triple bottom line (TBL) performance. That is, strategic marketing theory and research should answer: ""What explains differences in [social, environmental, and financial] performance of competing brands/product lines/businesses?"" This article provides a background discussion on how ""sustainability"" and the TBL relate to marketing in general and strategic marketing, in particular. Next, it (1) examines the nature of the TBL, (2) shows how the TBL concept and certain issues regarding its measurement parallel those in the ""corporate social responsibility"" literature, (3) re-examines the value of the TBL framework, (4) makes clear how R-A theory accommodates the TBL, and (5) shows how R-A theory provides seven potential explanations of differences in firms' TBL performance."

Combining big data and lean startup methods for business model evolution,"Seggie, Steven H. ;  Soyer, Emre ;  Pauwels, Koen H.",Big Data ;  Business and Management ;  Business models ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Startups ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2017, Vol.7 (3-4), p.154-169","The continued survival of firms depends on successful innovation. Yet, legacy firms are struggling to adapt their business models to successfully innovate in the face of greater competition from both local and global startups. The authors propose that firms should build on the lean startup methodology to help adapt their business models while at the same time leveraging the resource advantages that they have as legacy corporations. This paper provides an integrated process for corporate innovation learning through combining the lean startup methodology with big data. By themselves, the volume, variety and velocity of big data may trigger confirmation bias, communication problems and illusions of control. However, the lean startup methodology has the potential to alleviate these complications. Specifically, firms should evolve their business models through fast verification of managerial hypotheses, innovation accounting and the build-measure-learn-loop cycle. Such advice is especially valid for environments with high levels of technological and demand uncertainty."
The MIMIC model and formative variables: problems and solutions,"Lee, Nick ;  Cadogan, John W. ;  Chamberlain, Laura",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2013, Vol.3 (1), p.3-17","The use of the multiple indicators, multiple causes model to operationalize formative variables (the formative MIMIC model) is advocated in the methodological literature. Yet, contrary to popular belief, the formative MIMIC model does not provide a valid method of integrating formative variables into empirical studies and we recommend discarding it from formative models. Our arguments rest on the following observations. First, much formative variable literature appears to conceptualize a causal structure between the formative variable and its indicators which can be tested or estimated. We demonstrate that this assumption is illogical, that a formative variable is simply a researcher-defined composite of sub-dimensions, and that such tests and estimates are unnecessary. Second, despite this, researchers often use the formative MIMIC model as a means to include formative variables in their models and to estimate the magnitude of linkages between formative variables and their indicators. However, the formative MIMIC model cannot provide this information since it is simply a model in which a common factor is predicted by some exogenous variables—the model does not integrate within it a formative variable. Empirical results from such studies need reassessing, since their interpretation may lead to inaccurate theoretical insights and the development of untested recommendations to managers. Finally, the use of the formative MIMIC model can foster fuzzy conceptualizations of variables, particularly since it can erroneously encourage the view that a single focal variable is measured with formative and reflective indicators. We explain these interlinked arguments in more detail and provide a set of recommendations for researchers to consider when dealing with formative variables."

Constructing a theoretical framework for the process of innovation legitimation,"Thyroff, Anastasia ;  Siemens, Jennifer Christie ;  Murray, Jeff B.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Nanotechnology ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (3-4), p.180-194","The purpose of this research is to provide a framework for studying the key stakeholders who play a role in the process legitimation of an innovation. Specifically, we combine Foucault’s discourse on power, Latour’s Actor Network Theory and Goffman’s frame analysis to present a theoretical framework for the process of innovation legitimation (PIL). To demonstrate its usefulness, we apply the PIL framework to the context of nanotechnology. We ultimately determine that there are four key stakeholders trying to frame nanotechnology: 1) Advancement (i.e., government), 2) Management (i.e., industry), 3) Development (i.e., academia), and 4) Reflection (i.e., NGOs). The trajectory of market formation and legitimation for nanotechnology will depend largely on the cultural discourses that are disseminated by these four actors and the way other peripheral actors interpret the dominant frames. By conceptualizing the current frames for an innovation in the process of legitimizing, the future of each key discourse can be envisioned."

This commentary is a retrospective review, contributing to the understanding of the evolution of concepts and changes in the marketing discipline which have precipitated this identity crisis. In addition, progress in the development of marketing theory is examined to determine if there are major theories or frameworks that can assist in resolving the identity crisis. Concerns about the current narrow focus on consumer behavior, modeling, and methodological sophistication have resulted from the failure of the marketing discipline to determine appropriate research agenda and topics important in marketing education. A marketing systems paradigm is considered for resolving this identity crisis in academia and industry."
"The theoretical foundations of strategic marketing and marketing strategy: foundational premises, R-A theory, three fundamental strategies, and societal welfare","Hunt, Shelby D.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2015, Vol.5 (3-4), p.61-77","The strategic marketing field of study has long suffered from an identity problem: the field has lacked clarity and consensus as to its theoretical foundations, its nature, and its scope. There have been two recent approaches that contribute to resolving the identity problem. First, Varadarajan’s (

) approach focuses on strategic marketing's (1) domain, (2) definition, (3) fundamental issues, and (4) foundational premises. Second, resource-advantage (R-A) theory's approach focuses on how R-A theory provides a theoretical grounding for eight forms of business and marketing strategy. This article evaluates how the two approaches relate to each other and shows how R-A theory (1) grounds extant business and marketing theories of strategy, (2) illuminates, informs, extends, and grounds the sixteen foundational premises of the strategic marketing field that Varadarajan (
2010
) proposes, (3) implies that there are three fundamental strategies, “superior value”, “lower cost”, and “synchronal”, and (4) shows how the three fundamental strategies promote societal welfare. Therefore, the two approaches, when considered jointly, complement each other and foster the development of the field of strategic marketing and the forms of marketing strategy."
"Two minds, three ways: dual system and dual process models in consumer psychology","Samson, Alain ;  Voyer, Benjamin G.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2012, Vol.2 (2-4), p.48-71","Dual system and dual process views of the human mind have contrasted automatic, fast, and non-conscious with controlled, slow, and conscious thinking. This paper integrates duality models from the perspective of consumer psychology by identifying three relevant theoretical strands: Persuasion and attitude change (e.g. Elaboration Likelihood Model), judgment and decision making (e.g. Intuitive vs. Reflective Model), as well as buying and consumption behavior (e.g. Reflective-Impulsive Model). Covering different aspects of consumer decision making, we discuss the conditions under which different types of processes are evoked, how they interact and how they apply to consumers’ processing of marketing messages, the evaluation of product-related information, and purchasing behavior. We further compare and contrast theoretical strands and incorporate them with the literature on attitudes, showing how duality models can help us understand implicit and explicit attitude formation in consumer psychology. Finally, we offer future research implications for scholars in consumer psychology and marketing."
The transition from products to connected health: observations and avenues for future research,"Pitt, Leyland ;  Lord Ferguson, Sarah ;  Berthon, Pierre",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Corporate culture ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Strategic management,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (3-4), p.233-239","The transition of ResMed, the world’s leading manufacturer of therapies and devices for Obstructive Sleep Apnea, from a goods producer to an information-intensive firm presents a compelling opportunity for marketing scholars to revisit fundamental issues in strategic marketing’s theoretical past. These issues are still vitally relevant today and spark a host of interesting and important research opportunities for marketing scholars to pursue. In this commentary, we identify three important transformations undertaken by ResMed’s strategic leadership, which have strong ties to classical marketing theories and scholarship. First, ResMed moves from being a goods manufacturer to an information-intensive firm. This raises questions about the value of information that should intrigue marketing researchers. Second, the firm redefines its business, and does this not just once, but as is apparent from the case, on a dynamic basis. There are many avenues for marketing scholars of today to return to and explore in this regard. Third, ResMed makes substantial shifts in organizational culture, and also changes its structure as the result of its transformed strategy. While culture has been reasonably well considered in the marketing literature, the strategy-structure debate has mostly been conceded to strategic management scholars. There are still very fruitful research issues for marketing academics to explore in this regard."

Trust as a facilitator of co-creation in customer-salesperson interaction – an imperative for the realization of episodic and relational value?,"Baumann, Jasmin ;  Le Meunier-FitzHugh, Kenneth",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2014, Vol.4 (1-2), p.5-20","The co-creation of value is one of the key dynamic processes taking place within customer relationships. This paper emphasizes the importance of interaction between the customer and salesperson for the co-creation of value and theorizes how co-creation can be established between these actors through joint exploration of the customer’s value systems and value-generating processes, facilitated by interpersonal trust evolving at different interaction levels. We offer a series of propositions on how co-creation is engendered in all interactions from discrete to relational exchanges and how mutual value is realized from both the customer’s and salesperson’s perspective. The presented framework emphasizes that the actors require different levels of trust to engage in the co-creation of distinct value dimensions ranging from episode to relationship value."
The dynamic approach to business models,"Nyström, Anna-Greta ;  Mustonen, Miia",Alliances ;  Business and Management ;  Business models ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2017, Vol.7 (3-4), p.123-137","The many definitions of business models can be summarized into two distinct approaches, the static and the transformational. This paper proposes a third approach, namely a dynamic approach to business models and argues that the flexible and adaptive nature of business models can be developed further based on the industrial network approach. The business model is embedded in business contexts and business networks, and is dependent on changes in the business environment. Due to these mutual dependencies between business network actors, and in the pursuit of new capabilities and resources, the business model may also build on co-production, collectivity and sharing, and be utilized by the many actors embedded in value networks. This differs from the traditional view, in which companies create value independently of each other. A networked, flexible, and co-produced business model offers a novel tool for strategizing turbulent business environments."
Research on market orientation: Some lessons shared and issues discussed in a doctoral seminar,"Varadarajan, Rajan",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Market orientation ;  Marketing ;  Seminars ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2017, Vol.7 (1-2), p.26-35","For more than a quarter of a century, a large body of research in marketing, as well as in other disciplines, has focused on a number of substantive, theoretical and methodological issues relating to market orientation. Reflecting on their market orientation focused research journey, Jaworski and Kohli (

) offer 22 valuable lessons for researchers on the nuances of conducting field-based, discovery-oriented research. For over two decades, market orientation has been among the substantive topics on the syllabus of a doctoral seminar on strategic marketing that I have taught at Texas A&M University. Over the years, I have greatly benefited from reading a number of journal articles on market orientation, in preparing for the seminar session on market orientation. Reflecting on the insights gained from this learning journey, I elaborate on five lessons shared, and five issues discussed in the seminar."
A new conceptual lens for marketing: a configurational perspective based on the business model concept,"Leischnig, Alexander ;  Ivens, Björn S. ;  Kammerlander, Nadine",Business and Management ;  Business models ;  Entrepreneurs ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2017, Vol.7 (3-4), p.138-153","The business model concept has received strong interest among both practitioners and academics. As recent reviews of the literature on business models indicate, the number of articles that deepen the understanding of the role and nature of the business model concept as well as its antecedents and consequences has grown rapidly in the last years (e.g., Zott et al. in

), the purpose of this article is to discuss how marketing research and practice may benefit from a business model perspective and configurational thinking. We suggest that a business model can fruitfully be understood as a configuration of components embracing multiple domains and whose interdependent and interconnected structures influence the extent to which a firm can achieve strategic objectives and superior performance. We discuss which elements in business models are particularly linked to the field of marketing and how the role of these elements may differ in alternative configurations of business models. We conclude with an agenda for researchers from marketing and related disciplines that identifies avenues for further research on business models as configurations."
Exploring and extending a collective open business model,"Tower, Annette Popp ;  Noble, Charles H.",Business and Management ;  Business models ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2017, Vol.7 (3-4), p.170-182","Marketing research has paid scant attention to the notion of business models. This is surprising, considering that at the center of marketing is often the notion of creating a value proposition, one of the key components of business models. This paper identifies an emerging form of business model, which we term collective open business model, based on the concept of interdependent consumer collectives. We define an interdependent consumer collective as a group of consumers who benefit from resource complementarities in the pursuit of achieving a superior consumption experience. Grounded in interdependence theory, this paper conceptualizes the dynamics within the interdependent consumer collective which in turn influences the value creation, value delivery and value appropriation components of a collective open business model. Several unique attributes of a collective open business model are highlighted and future directions for research are discussed."
Corporate societal responsibility in marketing: normatively broadening the concept,"Murphy, Patrick E. ;  Öberseder, Magdalena ;  Laczniak, Gene R.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2013, Vol.3 (2), p.86-102","The premise of this paper is that corporate societal responsibility in marketing should go far beyond traditionally conceived corporate social responsibility (CSR). Admittedly, some typical efforts like philanthropy and executive volunteerism do have a distinct social component, but in recent years much CSR activity, including choices for corporate charity, are instrumentally infused with branding, product development, supply chain construction and a host of other strategic marketing decisions by corporations. This paper briefly reviews relevant CSR writings, presents a new definition of corporate societal responsibility in marketing, and advances several foundational premises for responsible marketing practice. Implications are drawn for both marketing scholarship and marketing management."

Journal of Marketing
article, entitled “Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity,” Kevin Keller argued persuasively that we can best understand, measure, and manage brands by understanding what consumers know about brands. In this commentary, I discuss the progress we have made in researching several areas of consumer branding, including measuring consumer brand knowledge and leveraging brands through brand extensions. Further, I identify challenges for future research in both areas, including needed developments in measuring brand association networks, researching global differences in consumer response to brand extensions, and understanding how contextual factors such as competitive environments affect brand extension success."
What makes a good theory practical?,"Calder, Bobby J. ;  Tybout, Alice M.",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Imagination ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2016, Vol.6 (3-4), p.116-124","This paper builds upon Zaltman’s call for greater imagination in theory and practice by exploring the role of imagination in building and applying good theories. It begins by juxtaposing everyday associations to the concept of imagination with scientists’ goal of developing theories that are objectively grounded in data. In research, imagination must focus on explaining
why
an effect may have occurred. Then, the practical value of such theorizing is explored. It is argued that good theories, though imagined, should to be viewed as real in that they offer a valuable viewpoint for solving practical problems. They expand the real world of the practitioner rather than existing in some ivory tower outside that world. A different sort of imagination, however, is required to move from an abstract theory to an intervention that can be implemented in the real world. Good theory can be highly practical but it requires separating research designed to build and test theory from research designed to evaluate the efficacy of theory-inspired interventions to real world problems."
In search of clarity on servant leadership: domain specification and reconceptualization,"VanMeter, Rebecca ;  Chonko, Lawrence B. ;  Grisaffe, Douglas B. ;  Goad, Emily A.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2016, Vol.6 (1-2), p.59-78","There is considerable confusion about what constitutes servant leadership. This paper outlines an approach to guide empirical investigation, while also addressing current inexact specifications of servant leadership, the issue of the unique dimensions of the construct, and distinctive characteristics of servant leadership considering other leadership styles. With knowledge of the abundance of servant leadership domain elements from the literature as a background, we provide a conceptually distinct approach to studying servant leadership to advise future measurement of the construct. Additionally, we discuss the convoluted state of the conceptual and empirical attributes that currently comprise the dimensions of servant leadership in relation to those proposed in existing definitions. Likewise, we delineate the challenges of empirically parsing out distinctive servant leadership traits in search of an operational definition, identifying traits that might be distinct to servant leaders, and discuss the implications from both theoretical and managerial perspectives; also, we provide directions for future research."

While this is certainly a logical and valid approach to this topic, it tends to overlook an important aspect of ethical decision making, namely the decision maker’s emotions or emotional state. Recently some scholars have begun to examine this “other side” of ethical decision making. Thus the current paper examines the literature regarding the role of emotions in ethical decision making, providing both an examination and synthesis of this literature. The paper culminates in both a theoretical model as well as testable research propositions."
Developing new marketing strategy theory: addressing the limitations of a singular focus on firm financial performance,"Bharadwaj, Sundar",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory\/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2015, Vol.5 (3-4), p.98-102","This commentary complements the Hunt (
2015
) essay and identifies the challenges that the R-A theory poses with its emphasis on superior financial performance as a firm’s primary and superordinate objective. It points to the need for new marketing strategy theory with a broader perspective of including other stakeholders beyond investors while designing firm objectives. In addition, the commentary points to short-termism as an inevitable consequence of focusing on financial performance. It thus calls for new marketing strategy theory that includes intermediate objectives based on customer mindset metrics that reflect intangible marketing assets."
A unified conceptualization of the attraction effect,"Sivakumar, K.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2016, Vol.6 (1-2), p.39-58","This research focuses on the attraction effect, a phenomenon in which the share of the focal alternative (called “target”), relative to a second alternative (called “competitor”), increases when a third alternative (termed “decoy”) is introduced, such that the target dominates the decoy but the competitor does not. On the one hand, research has demonstrated the existence of the attraction effect in a wide variety of situations; on the other hand, more recent research has questioned the existence of the effect under some circumstances. The purpose of this research is to provide a unified conceptual framework using the reference dependence and loss aversion principles of prospect theory to examine the circumstances under which the attraction effect benefits the target, the competitor, or neither. With its unifying conceptualization of the attraction effect, the research contributes to the literature by reconciling some contradictory findings and viewpoints and offering directions for further exploration."
An integrated framework for design perception and brand equity,"Mishra, Abhishek ;  Dash, Satyabhushan ;  Malhotra, Naresh K.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2015, Vol.5 (1-2), p.28-44","This conceptual work investigates the relationship between user-perceived product design and consumer-based brand equity. By integrating three independent and diverse theoretical perspectives, namely design value framework, means–end chains, and brand equity theory, we present a detailed literature review that relates consumer design perception to brand equity, mediated by consumption value. We also propose design perception as a multi-dimensional entity constituted of visual, functional, kinesthetic, interface, and information design perceptions. Consumption experience, manifested as experiential value, is conceptualized as a higher-order construct, with usability, social value, and pleasure in use forming the lower-order factors. Brand equity is also operationalized with five underlying components—brand association, perceived quality, perceived value, brand trust, and brand loyalty. Moderating effects of consumer characteristics on the relationship between design perception and the consumption value are also explored. By proposing a framework in line with the modern philosophy of design thinking, this work provides guidelines for practicing designers to work in conjunction with marketers, so as to create design elements that meet and shape consumers’ design needs, resulting in a positive consumer–brand relationship."
Exploring motivations and the capacity for business crowdsourcing,"Gassenheimer, Jule B. ;  Siguaw, Judy A. ;  Hunter, Gary L.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Review ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2013, Vol.3 (4), p.205-216","The use of crowds to solve business problems, or to take advantage of market opportunities, appears to be increasingly popular. The impact of crowdsourcing across the marketing domain, suggests the importance of examining this phenomenon. Firms use crowds of consumers to perform many of the traditional tasks of marketing, such as choosing designs (e.g., Threadless t-shirts), testing offerings (e.g., Microsoft), creating promotions (e.g., Facebook), and determining pricing (e.g., Travelocity). To more effectively harness the power of crowds and to learn from crowds, firms should understand their capacity for absorbing crowd contributions and the motives underlying the participation of the crowd as well as their own participation. An eclectic review of the literature offers a base for distinguishing crowds using a range of motives from intrinsic to extrinsic. Exploration of these dimensions results in a propositional inventory identifying motivations for both crowdsourcing and crowd participation. These inform practitioners of consequences of crowdsourcing decisions and offer future research directions."
Firms’ adoption of self-service technology: how managerial beliefs shape co-production decisions,"Di Mascio, Rita",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2016, Vol.6 (1-2), p.79-97","The level of service co-production offered to customers through self-service technologies (SSTs) is an important marketing decision. The extant literature reports numerous benefits of SSTs for firms, such as increasing efficiency, reducing costs, boosting loyalty, and reaching new customer segments. However, industry evidence suggests that firms vary in their adoption of SSTs. This article utilizes a managerial cognition perspective to relate the level of SST-based co-production to configurations of beliefs about desired organizational outcomes, customers, and knowledge. The resulting belief model illuminates why firms vary in their utilization of SSTs, and has implications for the judgment of newness of SST-based services, the ethics and politics of customer representation in SST design, and epistemologies of SST-based market exchanges."
A framework for the formation of governance portfolios in international interfirm marketing collaborations,"Dahlquist, Steven H. ;  Griffith, David A.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2015, Vol.5 (1-2), p.45-59","International interfirm marketing collaborations have become increasingly important in the competitive marketplace. Unfortunately, many are unsuccessful in achieving the desired objectives for one or both parties because of factors both internal and external. This work attempts to improve understanding of firms’ governance decision making and draw disparate literature streams together by introducing the concepts of collaborative intensity and collaborative alignment. Through the employment of institutional theory, this research offers a framework illustrating how institutional distance influences the nature of an international interfirm marketing collaboration when considering the constructs of collaborative intensity, collaborative alignment, and governance mechanisms."

Twenty years after its introduction, this paper explores R-A theory in the context of marketing strategy research and considers three main issues. First, while R-A theory has clearly been impactful, why it has not been relatively more impactful. Second, it identifies and elaborates on some important marketing strategy phenomena and questions that have not been explicitly addressed by R-A theory. Third, it offers some suggestions for the further development of R-A theory."

Specifically, this article provides answers to six of the most commonly asked questions. (1) Why is the model called “inductive realist”? (2) Is the real world of theory generation as linear as the model depicts? (3) Is the model positive or normative? (4) How does the model relate to the “theory-in-use” approach? (5) Is the model a testable, causal model? (6) Does all “problem recognition” start with “current disciplinary knowledge”?"
Retail capability systems,"Obeng, Efua ;  Prescott, John E. ;  Hulland, John ;  Gilbert, Robert ;  Maxham, James",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2015, Vol.5 (3-4), p.103-122","Drawing on the retail literature, archival records, and managerial interviews, we identify twelve capabilities associated with retail success. These capabilities are hierarchically grouped as foundational or supportive. Foundational capabilities are the basis upon which retail advantages are built, while supportive capabilities principally enhance the value of foundational capabilities. Drawing on systems theory, the loosely coupled systems perspective, and the Resource Based View, we propose that unique combinations of a foundational capability and an interdependent subset of supportive capabilities form four capability systems: brand management, merchandising, service, and market information management. The capability systems are socially complex and causally ambiguous making imitation by rivals particularly difficult. A retailer’s strategy determines the emphasis and focus placed on each of the four capability systems. We use the Miles and Snow (1978) strategy typology and the strategic fit literature to develop propositions linking our four capability systems to Defender, Analyzer, and Prospector strategies. We further propose that maintaining status-quo investments in all capabilities is necessary to achieve competitive parity. Ultimately, our capability systems perspective adds to the retail literature by enhancing our understanding of firm heterogeneity and performance."
Cultural dynamics and marketing strategies for emerging markets: characterization of group subcultures and consumption preferences,"Kivenzor, Gregory J.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2015, Vol.5 (3-4), p.142-158","Emerging markets (EMs) collectively represent more than half of the world population with rapidly increasing purchasing power. In spite of recent advances, consumer research of EMs is limited in scope and concept development and thus inadequately reflects EM realities in comparison with theories developed in and for the Western societies. Characterization of the dynamic changes in cultural ecology in EMs became an important area in need of conceptual and empirical research. The present study introduces a new conceptual framework—Taxonomy of Cultural Ecology—to better explain the cultural dynamics in EMs and predict changes in consumption preferences at a social group level—a key target for effective marketing strategies. Conceptual findings are connected with managerial implications relevant to marketing strategists, advertising managers and leaders of multinational corporations."

Reflections on marketing and imagination,"Wilkie, William L.",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2016, Vol.6 (3-4), p.125-131","This commentary on Professor Gerald Zaltman’s essay on Imagination in Marketing first commends the range and depth of this stimulating essay. The author then takes up some specific points made by Dr. Zaltman, illustrating how they have been manifested in his own academic experiences in the world of marketing. Instructional approaches come first, including why the course syllabus was banished from his MBA classroom, and how a special course aimed at stimulating students’ imaginations has evolved over time. Broader issues in the research realm are then addressed, beginning with the posing of a possible relationship between visual impediments and development of imagination. Topics that a new AMA Task Force might wish to address are then discussed, including the dominance of “consequentialism” in Business Schools, the imperialistic tendencies of metrics as applied to scholarly endeavors, the dangers of defining PhD students as immediate producers rather than immediate learners, and the continuing need for a larger view of our sprawling field of Marketing."

While independents are declining across established markets, such entities are of pivotal importance in developing economies. The present article aims at identifying the antecedents of buying behavior of small independent retailers in developing economies. In the process, their buying behavior is compared to the other classes of retailers. The literature on subsistence consumer-merchants as well as on embedded markets is reviewed to identify the antecedents of buying behavior of independents in developing economies. These antecedents are integrated into a framework of buying behavior of independents in developing economies. This framework may help marketers design appropriate strategies to reach consumers in developing economies. Insights developed in this article may also be used by independents in developing economies to devise methods that would enable them to fight against the spatial competitiveness of chains."

Specifically, the conventional MIMIC model is compared to alternative specifications recently suggested in the literature and issues relating to replacing formative latent variables with composites, predefining rather than estimating indicator weights, and aggregating indicators into single scores are discussed. Based on this analysis, concrete guidelines are provided to researchers on how to employ MIMIC models with formative indicators in their research endeavors."
"Remediating food deserts, food swamps, and food brownfields: helping the poor access nutritious, safe, and affordable food","Osorio, Arturo E. ;  Corradini, Maria G. ;  Williams, Jerome D.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2013, Vol.3 (4), p.217-231","Solutions to food insecurity need to address not only the lack of physical availability of food, as currently suggested by the literature, but also affordability, quality, and safety to be truly comprehensive. Marketing ensures that all consumers have equal access to products and services and that all relevant information is available so consumers can make educated consumption choices. This paper develops an urban food security model to help diagnose urban food systems and their shortcomings. Current understandings of food deserts and food swamps are clarified. The concept of food brownfields, places where conditions lead to above-average safety risks associated with food consumption, is introduced. Conditions in food-insecure communities are explored and contrasted to those in food-secure areas. These disparities inform our suggestions on how to provide innovative mechanisms to achieve true food security in poor urban areas. Policy-driven recommendations and future venues of research are subsequently advanced."

(also this issue). We contrast the approach taken in the latter paper (where we focus on clarifying the assumptions required to reject the formative MIMIC model) by spending time discussing what assumptions would be necessary to
accept
the use of the formative MIMIC model as a viable approach. Importantly, we clarify the implications of entity realism and show how it is entirely logical that some theoretical constructs can be considered to have real existence independent of their indicators, and some cannot. We show how the formative model only logically holds when considering these ‘unreal’ entities. In doing so, we provide important counter-arguments for much of the criticisms made in Diamantopoulos’ commentary, and the distinction also helps clarify a number of issues in the commentaries of Howell and Rigdon (both of which in general agree with our original paper). We draw together these various threads to provide a set of conceptual tools researchers can use when thinking about the entities in their theoretical models."
"Identity-motivated marketing relationships: research synthesis, controversies, and research agenda","Lam, Son K.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2012, Vol.2 (2-4), p.72-87","Social identity and identity theories have recently emerged as an important theoretical lens in relationship marketing research. However, the study of identity-motivated marketing relationships, defined as internal and external stakeholders’ identification with a marketing entity that can be an individual, a group, a brand, or a company, is not without controversies. Following a synthesis of this stream of research, this paper reviews the nature and causes of two key issues surrounding the conceptualization and measurement identity-based constructs. Recommended solutions and avenues for further research are then discussed."
An integrated model of cause-related marketing strategy development,"Liu, Gordon ;  Ko, Wai Wai",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2014, Vol.4 (3-4), p.78-95","Researchers in the fields of marketing and corporate social responsibility have suggested that cause-related marketing (CRM) can provide firms with opportunities for managing their community relationships and for enhancing their marketing, financial, social, and environmental performance. In this article, we offer a conceptual framework that helps to broaden the understanding of how firms develop CRM strategy. We identify three key CRM strategy development components: motivational factors, strategy design, and campaign tactics. The conceptual framework is constructed based on these three components to explore how the key CRM drivers influence the CRM implementation plan, which subsequently leads to the development of different campaign styles. We also propose that firms’ emphasis on value delivery systems in the process of CRM strategy development plays an important role in influencing the direction in which they wish to assemble their CRM campaign."

"Conceptual clarity in measurement—Constructs, composites, and causes: a commentary on Lee, Cadogan and Chamberlain","Howell, Roy D.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2013, Vol.3 (1), p.18-23","In an insightful and important article, Lee et al. (
2013
, this issue) clearly point out the problems with so-called formative measurement. In particular, they suggest that the MIMIC model formulation, as currently conceptualized, does not provide a solution. Their central thesis is that, in a MIMIC model, the supposedly formatively measured latent variable is empirically a reflective latent variable depending entirely on the endogenous variables included. They then look at composite variables as a possible solution. This commentary seeks to reinforce their central thesis, providing additional evidence and support. I also attempt to clarify the distinction between two types of models discussed in the article as MIMIC models. I then examine the use of composite variables, focusing on potential information loss and issues concerning conceptual clarity. I conclude that composite variables should not be routinely employed in theory testing research, and their use must be clearly justified."
Which controls are better for service outsourcing? Integrating service-dominant logic and service characteristics,"Roy, Subroto ;  Sivakumar, K.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2014, Vol.4 (3-4), p.45-62","A comprehensive examination of the role of outsourced services’ characteristics in determining control systems is lacking in the literature. While the service characteristics paradigm (intangibility, heterogeneity, inseparability, and perishability [IHIP]) has informed much of the services research in the past four decades, in the last decade, the service-dominant logic (SDL) has provided a new way to conceptualize the marketing of goods and services. However, there has been no attempt to integrate these two perspectives. This study fills these gaps by examining control systems in service outsourcing by means of a midrange theory that integrates the new SDL framework and the legacy of the service characteristics approach. The authors add a fifth characteristic, digitizability, to IHIP and develop a conceptual framework to derive research propositions based on the foundational premises of the SDL. They also examine the moderating effects of globalization and the outsourced service’s closeness to the organization’s core competence."
Knowledge needs of firms: the know-x framework for marketing strategy,"Madhavaram, Sreedhar ;  Gross, Andrew C. ;  Appan, Radha",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2014, Vol.4 (3-4), p.63-77","In today’s knowledge-intensive economy, the acquisition, development, and management of knowledge are fundamental to the survival and growth of firms. Consequently, organizational knowledge has emerged as a potential source of competitive advantage for firms. Specific to the marketing context, research has long since recognized the role of knowledge in effective marketing. Therefore, through a systematic review of organizational knowledge research and the knowledge business environment, this paper (1) identifies different types of organizational knowledge required by firms and develops the know-x framework, (2) discusses exemplars of different types of marketing knowledge products that firms might require, (3) identifies and discusses critical issues and concerns with reference to each of the marketing knowledge types, and (4) discusses the implications of knowledge types (know-x framework) for marketing strategy in general and market orientation strategy in particular. The paper concludes with a discussion of contributions and directions for future research."
Reinterpreting cultural priming effects in cross-cultural consumer research,"Merunka, Dwight R.",Business administration ;  Business and Management ;  Humanities and Social Sciences ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2013, Vol.3 (4), p.232-248","Experimentally priming bicultural individuals in cross-cultural consumer research to access their respective cultures has produced interesting findings. However, close examination of the experimental conditions and of the main findings reveals important inconsistencies and contradictions that cast doubt on their validity. In general, the risk of a cultural attribution fallacy is high in such cross-cultural research, due to the lack of control over three basic conditions that are required for successful cultural priming experiments: (1) the demonstrated biculturalism of study participants, (2) the experimental manipulations used to engender cultural switching, and (3) the procedures used to ensure that culture, rather than other processes such as stereotypical associations, is being stimulated and accessed. This manuscript discusses these conditions, proposes a descriptive model that clearly distinguishes the differential effects of cultural priming on either monocultural bilinguals or on bicultural individuals, and suggests a research agenda for better understanding and improving the implementation of the cultural priming research paradigm."

The utility of an information processing approach for behavioral price research,"Adaval, Rashmi",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2013, Vol.3 (3), p.130-134","In their article, Cheng and Monroe provide a historical perspective on behavioral research in pricing. Their consolidation of evidence spanning four decades of research on pricing is testimony to the richness that can result from the convergence of different perspectives and fields on a common set of phenomena. Although the article is framed in terms of concepts that have emerged from substantive concerns, there might be some utility in thinking about the issues in behavioral price research within the framework of an information processing model. Such a model allows one to localize different effects at various stages of processing and helps to raise additional issues to be investigated."
Effectual marketing planning for new ventures,"Whalen, Peter S. ;  Holloway, Samuel S.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2012, Vol.2 (1), p.34-43","Current marketing theories largely follow the rational planning school and base marketing planning activities upon a strategic pursuit of an optimal market outcome. While extant theory aligns with the motivations of large corporations in established markets, it offers little benefit to marketers in new ventures. We address this gap directly and propose a new concept of effectual marketing planning, which is based on a logic of control and specifically addresses the challenges facing new ventures. Our construct of effectual marketing planning contains five key elements that increase the value of marketing planning for new ventures. We conclude by offering propositions as to how effectual marketing planning can improve new venture performance."
"Explaining empirically successful marketing theories: the inductive realist model, approximate truth, and market orientation","Hunt, Shelby D.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Realism ;  Social Sciences ;  Success,"AMS review, 2012, Vol.2 (1), p.5-18","Some marketing theories are empirically successful, while others are not. When a marketing theory is empirically successful, is its success a result of miraculous good fortune or something else? For example, market orientation (MO) theory has been empirically successful: it explains and predicts numerous marketing phenomena. What explains the empirical success of MO theory? This article furthers the development of the philosophy of science foundations of marketing research by detailing the recently developed, “inductive realism” model of theory status and using the model to articulate scientific realism’s approximate truth as an explanation of the empirical success of marketing theories, in general, and MO theory, in particular. This article (1) briefly reviews the approaches to explaining the empirical success of science, with particular emphasis on scientific realism’s “no miracles” argument in favor of the approximate truth explanation, (2) discusses the problems associated with realists’ efforts to conceptualize “approximate truth,” (3) focuses on MO as a case-example of an empirically successful marketing theory and develops a “partial formalization” of MO theory for analysis purposes, (4) details the new, “inductive realist” model of theory status and applies the model to MO theory, (5) shows how the model accommodates the fact that, at times, sociological/political factors influence theory acceptance in science, (6) discusses whether political or other inappropriate factors have influenced MO theory’s success, (7) discusses the inductive realist approach to approximate truth and applies it to MO theory."
A Closer look at reference price: A commentary,"Lee, Angela Y.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Review ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2013, Vol.3 (3), p.151-154","In their historical overview of behavioral pricing research, Cheng and Monroe (
2013
) advanced five principles related to the concept of reference price: 1) there is a latitude of price indifference around a fuzzy reference price; 2) consumers may have a specific reference price for each product, sold at a particular channel, at a particular time or season, displayed amidst a particular array of other products; 3) the encounter of a new price results in the reference price shifting in the direction of the new price, resulting in an assimilation effect; 4) consumers are differentially sensitive to a price increase versus price decrease; 5) the sequential order and the distribution of prices have different effects on the reference price. This commentary highlights some of the interesting aspects of these concepts and discusses potential avenues for future research."

Customers’ coping with interpersonal conflicts in intra and inter-cultural service encounters,"Zourrig, Haithem ;  Chebat, Jean-Charles ;  Toffoli, Roy ;  Medina-Borja, Alexandra",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2014, Vol.4 (1-2), p.21-31","Customers may alter their conflict style depending on their cultural values’ orientations and whether the adversary belongs to their group or not. This paper provides cross-cultural insight into the psychological mechanisms that shape different styles of customer’s coping with interpersonal conflicts. Drawing on cognitive appraisal theory, the paper extends the framework of appraisal-emotions coping to different cultural–situational contexts and develops a set of theory-driven propositions. The insights from this conceptual paper suggest that within inter-cultural encounter contexts, an interpersonal conflict may lead to confrontative coping, for both allocentric and idiocentric customers. However, in the case of an intra-cultural encounter, the allocentrism trait may weigh against the pursuit of any conflict and therefore may increase the tendency of non-confrontational coping, while the idiocentrism trait is more likely to encourage adopting confrontative tactics regardless of the group belongingness of the frontline service employee."
Nomen est omen: formalizing customer labeling theory,"Plangger, Kirk ;  Kietzmann, Jan H. ;  Pitt, Leyland F. ;  Berthon, Pierre ;  Hannah, David",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Review ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2013, Vol.3 (4), p.193-204","Organizations use a variety of labels to refer to their customers — the individuals who use their products and services. These labels (e.g., guests, students, clients, members, patients, users, etc.) suggest different meanings and connotations than being a simple customer. In this paper, we explore traditional labeling theory, and its roots in categorization and semiotic theories, to aid in the understanding of the customer-firm relationship. We then extend and formalize this to a customer labeling theory, in which we posit that a firm’s labels for its customers may shape consumer and organizational attitudes. Therefore, if customers become what marketers call them, then these labels shape the dialog between organizations and their customers. Thus, customer labels indirectly impact the success of firms’ customer relationship management efforts. We discuss customer labeling implications for firms and make suggestions for future academic research."

Developing successful theories in marketing: insights from resource-advantage theory,"Hunt, Shelby D.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2011, Vol.1 (2), p.72-84","All disciplines require both (1) the development of theories that explain and predict important phenomena and (2) empirical research that tests the theories. Purely conceptual/theoretical articles are central to theory development and are generally more influential than empirical articles. However, not all conceptual articles are equally successful. This article addresses the issue of why some theoretical articles are more successful than others. Using a highly successful theory in marketing, resource-advantage theory, as a case-example, this article develops five guides for authors seeking to develop successful theories: (1) focus theory development on important issues in macromarketing and/or micromarketing, (2) craft theories with high explanatory and predictive power, (3) respect other disciplines’ literatures, (4) publish the theory in nonmarketing journals, and (5) explore the normative implications of the theory."

However, the rise of consumer generated content and its rapid diffusion have created a veritable epidemic of spoof ads aimed at companies and their brands. Brands are increasingly becoming the targets of burlesque. Marketers, faced with a loss of control over their message, are left wondering why some brands are mercilessly ridiculed while others seem impervious and immune. In this paper we address the central question of “which brands are most at risk of being parodied, and why?” To this end we develop a theory of spoof advertising based on the literatures of burlesque, satire, and caricature. We then apply the theoretical model to a well-known spoof ad to illustrate the theory’s explanatory power. Finally, we discuss avenues for future research in this area."
The relationship between cultural values and moral philosophy: a generational subculture theory approach,"Robertson, Christopher J. ;  Ralston, David A. ;  Crittenden, William F.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2012, Vol.2 (2-4), p.99-107",Scholarly interest in culturally-driven determinants of ethical behavior has grown substantially in recent years. This phenomenon is due to increasing pressure placed on top management teams of multinational firms to ensure high moral standards. One theory that has been overlooked in culture-based business ethics research is generational subculture theory. This theory will be explored in the current paper with respect to its relationship to moral philosophy. A theoretical model and conceptual matrix are developed and research propositions proposed. The resulting framework will aid future researchers of cross-cultural ethics due to the incorporation of generational subculture as a variable of analysis.

An important but underexplored antecedent of consumer innovativeness is time orientation. In this article, we propose a conceptual model of the relationships among time orientation, consumer innovativeness, and consumer innovative behavior.

These characteristics include (1) newness of the product, (2) product complexity, (3) network externalities, and (4) the utilitarian versus expressive nature of the product. We develop a series of research propositions to explicate the relationships in our conceptual model. We delineate the substantive and managerial implications by linking the variables through a comprehensive framework and provide future research directions."

Resale price maintenance and free riding: insights from multi-channel research,"Gundlach, Gregory T. ;  Manning, Kenneth C. ;  Cannon, Joseph P.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2011, Vol.1 (1), p.18-31","Resale price maintenance (RPM), a form of vertical price fixing, involves agreements between marketers at different levels in a distribution system to establish the resale price at which sales of a product or service will occur. The Supreme Court’s decision in
Leegin v. PSKS
altered the legal standards applicable to minimum RPM and has resulted in an increase in the use of RPM by marketers. The lack of contemporary research on RPM and its effects on competition has led to initiatives and calls for research on this marketing practice. In the current paper, the authors synthesize findings from extant multi-channel research relevant to understanding the primary procompetitive justification for RPM– the so-called “free rider” thesis. The findings of this research augment antitrust understanding of RPM in important and novel ways."
Marketing strategy: discerning the relative influence of product and firm characteristics,"Varadarajan, Rajan",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2011, Vol.1 (1), p.32-43","A business’s marketing strategy decisions (how a business chooses to compete in the marketplace) are informed by the characteristics of the firm, the product offering, the target customers, the industry, and macro environment, among other factors. The literature in marketing focusing on the marketing strategy implications of product characteristics and customer characteristics is vast and extensive, spanning several decades. During the past four decades, literature insights from the fields of economics and management have contributed to enhancing our understanding of the marketing strategy implications of industry characteristics and firm characteristics, respectively. While the marketing strategy implications of product characteristics generalize to all competitors of a specific product offering, the marketing strategy implications of firm characteristics are idiosyncratic to individual competitors. Competing businesses strive to achieve and sustain defensible competitive positional advantages in the marketplace by effectively leveraging their organizational capabilities to deploy firm resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and/or non-substitutable. In effect, heterogeneity in resources and capabilities manifest as heterogeneity in the business and marketing strategies of competitors. A likely consequence of heterogeneity in organizational capabilities is differences among competitors in their quality of understanding the marketing strategy implications of product characteristics and, in turn, their marketing strategies informed by the distinctive characteristics of the product offering. Against this backdrop, this article explores the relative influence of product characteristics and firm characteristics on a business’s marketing strategy and the moderating effect of firm characteristics."
Comparative insights into the governance problems of agency theory: the influence of institutional environment on the basic human tenets,"Lee, Hannah S. ;  Griffith, David A.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2012, Vol.2 (1), p.19-33","Agency theory is used to explain many firm marketing activities. However, its assumptions are founded in characteristics of North American actors, particularly in the United States. As such, it is not surprising that work employing agency theory in other national contexts often fails to find support. Taking a comparative institutional approach, this article theorizes how the human assumptions and prescriptions of agency theory differ across countries by utilizing the three pillars (i.e., regulative, normative, and cognitive) set forth by institutional theory. In particular, attenuations of the human assumptions of self-interest, risk-aversion, and bounded rationality of agents are theorized to influence goal alignment, risk sharing, and information processing in the agency relationship and in turn, effect prescriptions of governance and contracting given by the traditional agency model. A series of research propositions are developed to provide insight into the contractual implications in the principal-agent relationship across different institutional contexts. The theoretical attenuations presented provide guidance for marketing academics and practitioners engaged in cross-national agency relationships."

Whereas malicious envy may be less common in general, it may be concentrated in domains requiring self-regulation to prevent over-indulgence. Additional research is needed to increase our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms involved in consumer envy and consumers’ choices of the targets of envy, as well as the consequences of envy for the marketplace."

He argues that while the phenomnon continues to be pervasive, current cultural conditions temper the extent to which envy has morphed from a malicious equation of “if you win, I lose” to a more benign calculus of “I want to win like you have.” In this commentary I reflect upon the validity of Belk’s proposal and suggest a few social science perspectives to complement his treatise. I also offer some additional considerations—especially in light of consumers’ nascent abilities to more easily acquire and accumulate the (virtual) goods they covet in digital marketplaces."
