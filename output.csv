The primary finding and contribution of this study is a pathway by which interactions of failure attributions and emotions lead to effective entrepreneurial reentry in the aftermath of a failure. Specifically, we identify three trajectories of reentry: separation (reentry with minimal modifications), reinforcement (no reentry), and metamorphosis (reentry with substantial modifications). We describe the differences between the trajectories and detail three dimensions of our primary contribution: negative emotions are not necessarily an obstacle to reentry, as previously thought; perceived controllability is critical in explaining reentry; and the evolution of attributional/emotional responses over time as a result of the interplay between these concepts is central to explaining effective reentry."

How Digitalization Changes our Understanding of Professional Service Firms,"kronblad, charlotta","Business Administration ;  Economic Geography ;  Ekonomisk geografi ;  Företagsekonomi ;  Information Systemes, Social aspects ;  Systemvetenskap, informationssystem och informatik med samhällsvetenskaplig inriktning","Academy of Management discoveries, 2020, Vol.6 (3), p.436","The digital transformation currently at play changes the conditions for firms across different industries which challenges the way we have previously understood them. As the economy is becoming increasingly knowledge-based and service-oriented, the professional service firms (""PSFs"") are of particular importance. Being characterized by high knowledge intensity, low capital intensity, and professionalized workforces, these firms have developed certain management practices and organizational forms. However, despite being persistent and remarkably successful over time, PSFs are starting to change. This article suggests that digitalization is the driver of these changes and draws on empirical data fromlawfirms to analyze the effects of digitalization on the distinctive characteristics of PSFs. The findings show that digitalization enables legal service delivery at lower levels of knowledge intensity, whereas it increases capital intensity for most firms and decreases the professionalization of the workforce. Consequently, this article argues that digitalization has changed the distinctive characteristics of PSFs, which promotes new practices, allows for variation, and transforms their competitive contexts. In light of these findings, we should reconsider our understanding of PSFs."

The Effect of Institutional Logics on Business Model Development in the Sharing Economy: The Case of German Carsharing Services,"Vaskelainen, Taneli ;  Münzel, Karla ;  Dynamics of Innovation Systems ;  Innovation Studies",Taverne,"Academy of Management discoveries, 2018, Vol.4 (3), p.273-293","The forces influencing business model development are widely discussed in the literature, but so far, the effects of macro-level forces such as institutional logics have received little attention. This study describes the effects of institutional logics in the context of business model development in the German carsharing industry. We longitudinally analyze a rich qualitative dataset from the start of professional carsharing in 1988?2015 to uncover the forces influencing the business models. We find that the two main business models?the free-floating model and the station-based model?have developed along disparate trajectories because the actors in the market are committed to different institutional logics. Corporate-backed companies that operate the free-floating business model are committed to corporation logic, and the small, environmentally minded organizations that operate in a station-based model are committed to community logic. We contribute to the business model literature by presenting institutional logics as a moderating force that empower some development trajectories and inhibit others. We also argue that commitment to community logic concerns actors in many other sharing economy markets outside of German carsharing. We discuss the implications of this proposition and suggest topics for further research.Whiteboard Video AbstractAOM Video Player5827303552001"

Image concerns are a potential barrier, specifically concerning how a leader will be perceived by employees when adopting an error management orientation. Using an experimental study (Study 1; 73 student and nonstudent participants) and a field study (Study 2; 454 employees and 95 leaders), we explore the relationship between leaders’ perceived error orientation and employees’ perceptions of the warmth and competence of those leaders. Moreover, in Study 2, we extend our findings by testing the indirect effects of leader error orientation via perceived leader warmth and competence on indicators of employees’ work-related outcomes (i.e., job satisfaction, turnover intention, work engagement, employee job performance). Our findings provide the first evidence to suggest that leaders should not be reluctant to apply error management in their practice, as it offers benefits both for employees’ perception of leaders and for employees’ work-related outcomes. To inspire future research, we propose an integrative theoretical model of the interindividual effects of leader error orientation on employee-perceived leader warmth, competence, and work-related outcomes at both the individual and team levels."

For these companies, the social issue of obesity constitutes a strategic social–business tension. We conduct a qualitative study of the print media coverage on the public debate around obesity to analyze how companies discursively respond to strategic tensions around this widely salient issue. We identify the accepting-defensive approach to strategic social–business tensions that companies use to protect the autonomy over their core business vis-à-vis pressures and demands from the public debate around obesity. We unearth the two discursive mechanisms—choice of discursive tactics and construction of tensions—that underlie this accepting-defensive approach. In contrast to what the literature on organizational tensions suggests, corporate responses to strategic tensions go beyond the dichotomy of accepting-constructive and rejecting-defensive responses. We offer a better understanding of the discursive mechanisms that companies use to maintain autonomy when facing strategic tensions around widely salient social issues."

These measurement instruments undoubtedly will be helpful to advance research on the micro-level antecedents and outcomes of these social evaluations and will prove instructive for the development of measures for related evaluations, such as organizational stigma, and celebrity. However, while we appreciate the authors’ work and contribution to a microfoundational agenda in research on social evaluations, we have some concerns with regard to their measurement approach. Specifically, although Bitektine and colleagues (2019) stress the multi-level nature of social evaluations, they do not translate this insight into a measurement instrument that acknowledges that individual evaluators hold both private judgments (“first-order judgments”) and judgments about the collective-level judgment (i.e., judgments of the judgments of other evaluators in a specific reference group, or “second-order judgments”). These two types of individual judgments reflect different facets of social evaluations and have different effects on individual behavior, and thus researchers need to avoid conflating them within a measurement instrument. Our commentary seeks to complement the approach of Bitektine and colleagues (2019) by sensitizing readers to the distinction between first-order and second-order judgments and by developing recommendations for future scale development efforts. These recommendations are given in a spirit of collegiality and with an understanding that progress in social evaluation research requires the concerted effort of many researchers over many years."

When is Psychological Safety Helpful? A Longitudinal Study,"Higgins, Monica ;  Dobrow, Shoshana Ruth ;  Weiner, Jennie Miles ;  Liu, Haiyang",,,"Prior research has documented many benefits associated with team-level psychological safety. However, we know little about the boundary conditions of psychological safety, such as how it operates at the organization level and if and when it is helpful over time. In the present research, we explore how organization-level psychological safety, in conjunction with another aspect of workplace climate, felt accountability, impacts organizational performance over time. Our study is situated in the New York City public school system, a context rife with uncertainty and calls for change, including immense pressure on teachers to produce and improve student outcomes. Drawing on over 170,000 survey responses from teachers in 545 schools across three years, our multilevel analyses unexpectedly show that psychological safety is not on its own, nor necessarily, “helpful” with regards to organizational performance over time. Indeed, the best conditions for fostering organizational performance occurred when psychological safety was relatively low and felt accountability was relatively high. Thus, these two dimensions of workplace climate appear to be interrelated in critical ways over time, albeit unexpectedly. We conclude with implications of our discoveries for future research on psychological safety and felt accountability, and we propose new lines of research on the roles of interdependence, attention, and time for studying psychological safety at the organization level."

Pitching for Social Change: Towards a Relational Approach to Sellling and Buying Social Issues,"Wickert, C.M.J ;  de Bakker, F.G.A",,"Academy of Management discoveries, 2018, Vol.4 (1), p.50-73","In the issue-selling literature, little attention has been paid to the struggles of those managers who try to sell social issues to potential issue buyers who are not particularly sensitive to the normative elements of these social issues. In this study, we examine the case of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and concomitant dynamics of selling social issues and address two interrelated questions. First, how do the sellers of social issues perceive themselves and their organizational roles, and how does this motivate them to engage in selling social issues in the first place? Second, how do these perceptions influence the strategies that issue sellers use to win over skeptics? To answer these questions, we focus on the relationships that issue sellers build with buyers and on the role of this form of engagement in overcoming resistance to social issues. Our findings shed new light on the motivation, aspirations, and strategies of issue sellers and suggest that a relational approach can provide important insights into understanding selling and buying social issues within organizational contexts. Furthermore, our findings pave the way for future research on selling social issues as a relational endeavor."

Rethinking the sharing economy : the nature and organization of sharing in the 2015 refugee crisis,"Martin, Kornberger ;  Stephan, Leixnering ;  Renate E., Meyer ;  Markus, Hoellerer",Business administration ;  Economics and Finance ;  Humanities and Social Sciences,"Academy of Management discoveries, 2017 (4 (3))","Our article focuses on a non-standard sharing example that harbors the potential to disrupt received wisdom on the sharing economy. Although, originally, entering the field to analyze, broadly from a governance perspective, how the 2015 refugee crisis was handled in Vienna, Austria, we found that the non-governmental organization Train of Hope—labeled as a ‘citizen start-up’ by the City of Vienna officials—played an outstanding role in mastering the crisis. In a blog post during his visit in Vienna at the time, and experiencing the refugee crisis first-hand, it was actually Henry Mintzberg who suggested reading the phenomenon as part of the ‘sharing economy’. Continuing this innovative line of thought, we argue that our unusual case is in fact an excellent opportunity to discover important aspects about both the nature and organization of sharing. First, we uncover an additional dimension of sharing beyond the material sharing of resources (i.e., the economic dimension): the sharing of a distinct concern (i.e., the moral dimension of sharing). Our discovery exemplifies such a moral dimension that is rather different from the status quo materialistic treatments focusing on economic transactions and property rights arguments. Second, we hold that a particular form of organizing facilitates the sharing economy: the sharing economy organization (SEO). This particular organizational form is distinctive—at the same time selectively borrowing and skillfully combining features from platform organizations (e.g., use of technology as an intermediary for exchange and effective coordination, ability to tap into external resources) and social movements (e.g., mobilization, shared identity, collective action). It is a key quality of this form of organization to enable the balancing of the two dimensions inherent in the nature of sharing: economic and moral. Our article contributes to this special issue of the Academy of Management Discoveries by highlighting and explaining the two-fold economic and moral nature of sharing and the organization of sharing between movement and platform."

Implications of Childcare Responsibilities for Workplace Performances & Interactions,"Conzon, Vanessa ;  Huising, Ruthanne",Business administration ;  Economics and Finance ;  Humanities and Social Sciences,"Academy of Management discoveries, 2015 (2015 (1))","Scientists with childcare responsibilities are evaluated by their colleagues as less competent and committed. The flexibility stigma has been extensively documented; however, the processes and mechanisms through which the use of flexible work arrangements lead to the flexibility stigma has received less attention. In this theory development paper, we identify mechanisms, grounded in workplace observation, that explain why faculty members who adapt their schedules to care for children may experience stigma in the workplace. We analyze and compare the time control approaches of female and male professors in the physical and formal sciences with and without childcare responsibilities. We show the implications time control and allocation strategies have for social exchange – specifically performances and interactions – in the workplace. Women with childcare responsibilities allocate most workplace interactions and performances to ""service science"" in which they are seen contributing - teaching and serving – to their department. They perform their research activities primarily in private and outside the office. Men without childcare responsibilities allocate most workplace interactions and performances to ""public science"" in which they publicly interact with peers on topics of science. Men with childcare responsibilities combine service science and public science. In performing service science, women with childcare responsibilities experience isolation from peers and develop reputations around service and teaching work. This may in turn lead colleagues to view them as less committed and competent. We discuss potential implications for scientific productivity, connecting our findings to recent studies of gendered productivity, patenting, and scientific advisory board participation findings."
