Designing conceptual articles: four approaches,"Jaakkola, Elina",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (1-2), p.18-26","As a powerful means of theory building, conceptual articles are increasingly called for in marketing academia. However, researchers struggle to design and write non-empirical articles because of the lack of commonly accepted templates to guide their development. The aim of this paper is to highlight methodological considerations for conceptual papers: it is argued that such papers must be grounded in a clear research design, and that the choice of theories and their role in the analysis must be explicated and justified. The paper discusses four potential templates for conceptual papers – Theory Synthesis, Theory Adaptation, Typology, and Model – and their respective aims, approach for using theories, and contribution potential. Supported by illustrative examples, these templates codify some of the tacit knowledge that underpins the design of non-empirical papers and will be of use to anyone undertaking, supervising, or reviewing conceptual research."
A conceptual perspective on collaborative consumption,"Ertz, Myriam ;  Durif, Fabien ;  Arcand, Manon",Business and Management ;  Collaboration ;  Consumption ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (1-2), p.27-41","While considerable investigative work has focused on collaborative consumption (CC) from a managerial standpoint, the concept still lacks the conceptual groundwork necessary to categorize and fully understand its scopes and limits. In this article, the authors draw upon past research to delineate the construct, discuss its dimensionalities, and propose a conceptualization of CC. The CC concept is based on six key thrusts: (1) the consumer’s ability to switch sides; (2) the collaboration intensity; (3) the manner in which consumers partake in CC; (4) the transfer of ownership and use; (5) the channels used; and (6) the extended range of stakeholders in collaborative exchanges. This analytical endeavour brings to the fore the multidimensional aspect of CC, the centrality of a two-sided instead of a one-sided consumer role, and the extent to which both CC (collaborative consumption) and conventional consumption (conventional economy) are tightly interrelated."
Toward a theory of ethical consumer intention formation: re-extending the theory of planned behavior,"Sun, William",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.260-278","What drives consumers to purchase or not purchase ethical products remains something of a puzzle for consumer behavior researchers. Existing theory—particularly the widely applied theory of planned behavior (TPB)—cannot fully explain ethical purchase decisions. This article contends that not only is the original TPB limited in its applicability to ethical purchasing contexts but also subsequent modifications to it have been generally unfitting. This study advances the literature by taking a different approach to recharacterize and re-extend the original components of the TPB in order to make it more relevant and effective for explaining and predicting ethical consumer decisions. This new theoretical framework of intention formation features four determinants (attitude, subjective norm, moral identity, and perceived behavior control) and a key moderator (level of confidence), and thereby possesses better explanatory and predictive abilities to understand ethical consumer decisions."
Toward an integrative theory of marketing,"Parvatiyar, Atul ;  Sheth, Jagdish N.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.432-445","Many scholars have observed that the marketing discipline has become too fragmented and myopic, straying away from its core managerial marketing issues. To some, the complex discipline-transgressing phenomena are knowledge-producing, while for others, it is the discipline's problem of an identity crisis. This article argues that continuities and discontinuities of theoretical and methodological processes result from the contextual forces that continuously create new perspectives, paradigms, and schools of thought. Many traditional schools of marketing thought have either become obsolete or metamorphosized into new schools of thought. It has led to several theoretical advances that promise to develop into a general theory of marketing. However, none have grown into a full-blown integrative theory of marketing to tie in the various subdisciplines of marketing. We present an overall framework of marketing that could become the basis for developing an integrative theory of marketing with views relating to the core marketing processes and how the evolving contextual forces interactively impact them."
Marketing’s theoretical and conceptual value proposition: opportunities to address marketing’s influence,"Key, Thomas Martin ;  Clark, Terry ;  Ferrell, OC ;  Stewart, David W. ;  Pitt, Leyland",Business and Management ;  Conceptual ;  Conceptual and theoretical research ;  Discipline drift ;  Discipline myopia ;  Marketing ;  Marketing influence ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.151-167","This paper is composed of scholarly essays that explore the problematic nature of marketing’s influence within the academy and organizations, potential explanations and causes, and how conceptual and theoretical research can address and move our discipline forward. Each section represents material and research developed through interactive sessions from Academy of Marketing Science conferences. Topics include the history of the marketing discipline, its innovation and loss of domain expertise; important internal and external environmental concepts that have impeded relevance and theoretical impact; foundational elements of how the discipline frames problems, provides methodological-based solutions, and influences the very subjects of our research in such a way as to lesson our contribution to scholarship and practice; and finally the discipline’s inability to understand the intangible nature of marketing activities and outcomes, as well as marketers’ struggle to articulate relevance in a way that is easily understood in the language of finance. Through this critical self-examination of the field of marketing a central premise emerged—a discipline-wide drift and myopic approach to rigor and relevance."
Service innovation is urgent in healthcare,"Berry, Leonard L.",Business and Management ;  Innovations ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (1-2), p.78-92","Healthcare is a service setting where meeting the needs of customers (patients and their families) is uniquely challenging. But the necessity, complexity, cost, and high-emotion nature of the service, as well as technological advances and competitive dynamics in the industry, make the imperative for
service innovation
in healthcare especially urgent. Forward-thinking healthcare institutions around the United States are succeeding in establishing a value-creating innovation culture and in implementing operational and strategic service innovations that benefit them and their stakeholders. They view continuous innovation as a non-negotiable goal, prize institutional self-confidence, and include patients and families on the innovation team. Cancer care, in particular, faces a pressing need for service innovation, and some progressive oncology centers are demonstrating what is possible to improve the patient and family service experience. The imperatives, now, are for service innovation to become part of the fabric of how all healthcare institutions, not just the groundbreakers discussed in this article, operate—and for academics in the field of marketing to play a crucial role in that effort."
Conceptual review papers: revisiting existing research to develop and refine theory,"Hulland, John",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (1-2), p.27-35","Conceptual review papers can theoretically enrich the field of marketing by reviewing extant knowledge, noting tensions and inconsistencies, identifying important gaps as well as key insights, and proposing agendas for future research. The result of this process is a theoretical contribution that refines, reconceptualizes, or even replaces existing ways of viewing a phenomenon. This paper spells out the primary aims of conceptual reviews and clarifies how they differ from other theory development efforts. It also describes elements essential to a strong conceptual review paper and offers a specific set of best practices that can be used to distinguish a strong conceptual review from a weak one."
Theorizing markets,"Kjellberg, Hans ;  Murto, Riikka",Business and Management ;  Editorial ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.207-215",
Consequences of mandated usage of innovations in organizations: developing an innovation decision model of symbolic and forced adoption,"Heidenreich, Sven ;  Talke, Katrin",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.279-298","In organizations, mandated adoption contexts are the rule rather than the exception. Individuals, who are denied the choice between adopting and rejecting an innovation, are more likely to engage in opposition behavior, particularly if the innovation conflicts with their held beliefs. Interestingly, neither the construct of forced adoption nor its consequences have received much research attention. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review and provide theoretical rationales for the emergence of innovation resistance and opposition behaviors in organizations. We then develop an innovation decision model of individual adoption behavior that localizes negative outcomes of the secondary adoption process along the different process stages, providing insights into their emergence and potential consequences for the organization. Furthermore, we identify important avenues for future research and show how our innovation decision model can be used to advance theory development on forced adoption."
Re-examining utopia in contemporary consumption: conceptualization and implications for marketing,"Atanasova, Aleksandrina",Business and Management ;  Conceptual ;  Desire ;  Escape ;  Experiential consumption ;  Liquid consumption ;  Marketing ;  Retailing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory ;  Theory/Conceptual ;  Utopia,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.23-39","This paper introduces liquid consumer utopias, defined as market-mediated expressions of individuals’ desires to re-imagine and re-construct reality, and to re-frame the present. This conceptual lens illuminates previously untheorized consumption phenomena, which are socially constructed, and often critical, efforts to enact an alternative way of being in an increasingly uncertain and unpredictable world. Three key characteristics of liquid utopias are outlined—immediacy, transience and hyper-individualization––each pointing to liquid consumer utopias’ function to facilitate present-oriented and short-lived re-imaginings of reality. Co-existing alongside the solid and collective utopian consumption of interest to prior research, these emergent forms of liquid consumer utopias articulate a re-imagining of the present (rather than the future), have an emphasis on individual (rather than communal) experiences of betterment, and an orientation toward temporary re-framings of the experienced reality (rather than a pursuit of permanence and long-lasting change). Implications are discussed for retailing, experiential consumption, and consumer self-optimization."
Sustainable marketing based on virtue ethics: addressing socio-ecological challenges facing humankind,"Dyck, Bruno ;  Manchanda, Rajesh V.",Business and Management ;  Conceptual ;  Ethics ;  Marketing ;  Marketing 4 Ps ;  Marketing-mix paradigm ;  Social Sciences ;  Sustainability ;  Theory ;  Theory/Conceptual ;  Triple Bottom Line ;  Utilitarian ethics ;  Virtue ethics,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.115-132","It is generally accepted that the primary goal of marketing, even conventional sustainable marketing, is to enhance organizations’ financial well-being, a view that is consistent with mainstream utilitarian ethics. However, this profit-first focus often inadvertently contributes to socio-ecological problems and undermines the ability of marketing to adequately address resulting challenges. This paper presents an approach to sustainable marketing that we call Social and Ecological Thought (SET) marketing, which is based on virtue ethics and aims to optimize social and ecological well-being while ensuring financial viability. We describe implications of SET marketing for each of the 4 Ps in the marketing-mix paradigm—product, price, place, and promotion—and compare them to conventional views based on mainstream utilitarian ethics. SET marketing is relevant for the growing number of consumers and businesses that willingly forgo the maximization of financial well-being in order to optimize socio-ecological well-being. Implications for theory and practice are discussed."
The Möbius strip of market spatiality: mobilizing transdisciplinary dialogues between CCT and the marketing mainstream,"Coffin, Jack ;  Chatzidakis, Andreas",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.40-59","This paper develops the Möbius strip as an ‘ordering theory’ (Sandberg and Alvesson,
2020
) that brings CCT studies into dialogue with mainstream marketing approaches. The aim is to work toward a transdisciplinary understanding of market spatiality, a topic that has become increasingly important for theorists and practitioners (Warnaby and Medway,
2013
; Castilhos et al., 
2016
; Chatzidakis et al., 
2018
). Building on psychosocial interpretations of the Möbius strip as a ‘tactical’ way of thinking, a range of insights and ideas are organized along a single strip of theorization. This paper maps a continuous plane of logic between the concepts of space, place, emplacement, spatiality, implacement, and displacement. The potential applications of the Möbius strip are then demonstrated by showing how the transdisciplinary topic of ‘atmosphere’ can be theorized from multiple perspectives. The paper concludes by exploring how the Möbius strip might also be employed in other areas of marketing theory and practice, potentially generating further transdisciplinary conversations between CCT and the marketing mainstream."
The new frontier of consumer experiences: escape through pain,"Cova, Bernard",Anti-structure ;  Business and Management ;  CCT ;  Conceptual ;  Consumers ;  Escape ;  Experience ;  Humanities and Social Sciences ;  Marketing ;  Orwell ;  Pain ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory ;  Theory/Conceptual ;  Whitening,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.60-69","Terms such as
consumer experience
and
experiential consumption
have become ubiquitous in the realm of marketing. The last decades have seen a dramatic increase in academic publications exploring these concepts across many different streams and have resulted in significant advances in scholarly understanding. Consumer culture theory (CCT) scholars have particularly participated in this effort by investigating extraordinary experiences and framing them as escapes from everyday life. This paper proposes a summary of CCT contributions on extraordinary experiences and emphasizes the way these works have used the structural/anti-structural coexistence theory to depict the experiences consumers live through. Then it mobilizes a fiction to improve the understanding of escape. This paper highlights how painful leisure pursuits enable consumers to reconnect with their bodies, affording them moments of escape from an otherwise saturated self. The paper shows how the concept of self-escape is important to envision the possibilities in marketing painful experiences."
The influence of media multitasking on advertising effectiveness,"Garaus, Marion",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.244-259","Recent years have seen an increasing trend among consumers toward using two or more media simultaneously, a phenomenon known as media multitasking. The majority of the extant literature agrees that media multitasking has detrimental effects on advertising effectiveness. However, opportunities exist for reducing these negative effects or even creating effects favorable to advertising outcomes. Nevertheless, the literature on media multitasking during advertising exposure is highly fragmented and findings are inconclusive. This literature review synthesizes the extant studies on message processing in media multitasking situations. It develops a comprehensive conceptual framework on the effects of media multitasking on advertising effectiveness, with particular attention to mediating processes and moderating variables. The conceptual model explains the circumstances under which individuals devote voluntary or involuntary attention to advertisements during media multitasking, advances knowledge on the role of different sensory modalities, and reveals how the two types of information processing complement each other during simultaneous media usage."
Rethinking marketing: back to purpose,"Fehrer, Julia A.",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Grand challenges ;  Market shaping ;  Marketing ;  Marketing myopia ;  Social Sciences ;  Systems thinking ;  Value cocreation,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.179-184","Key and colleagues raise some serious criticisms related to the marketing discipline’s purpose drift and short-sighted approach to rigor and relevance. They provide a comprehensive and nuanced picture of the grand challenges in marketing, including the loss of domain expertise, detachment from real-world phenomena, nurturing of methodological monocultures and more generally a perception problem in academia and management practice. This commentary complements their assessment by reviewing strands of literature in the niches and at the edge of mainstream marketing, where we may find some solutions or at least seeds for solutions as a starting point to refine, recalibrate and potentially reshape the future of marketing and marketing research."
Indigenous theory development in marketing: the foundational premises approach,"Hunt, Shelby D.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (1-2), p.8-17","Marketing’s intellectual health requires indigenous theory development. However, marketing is a discipline that, almost exclusively, imports its concepts and theories from other disciplines and applies them to marketing issues. Articles that either
develop
indigenous marketing theory or
use
such theory as a foundation for empirical research are notably absent from marketing journals. A major reason for the absence of indigenous marketing theory is the lack of well-developed procedures and approaches for developing theories and writing conceptual articles. This article proposes, explicates, and illustrates with a concrete example (i.e., service-dominant (S-D) logic) an approach to theory development in marketing that is labeled the “foundational premises, inductive realist approach.” Although this approach is not an algorithmic procedure for theory development, it can provide a valuable conceptual framework for furthering the development of indigenous marketing theory."
A service design approach to healthcare innovation: from decision-making to sense-making and institutional change,"Patrício, Lia ;  Grenha Teixeira, Jorge ;  Vink, Josina",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Decision making ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (1-2), p.115-120","Healthcare is facing complex challenges that demand profound service system innovation. Service design offers an opportunity to move beyond explanatory research and take an action-oriented approach that combines research rigor with relevance to foster innovation in healthcare. We present three research projects that illustrate different ways service design can enable health service system innovation to create uplifting changes in wellbeing. The first research project utilizes a decision-making approach to support design teams in developing value co-creating technology-enabled services for skin cancer prevention. The second project employs a sense-making approach through participatory design to develop a National Electronic Health Record that addresses the multiple and conflicting goals of healthcare network actors. The third project uses an institutional change approach to develop a new digital service for youth with mental health issues while simultaneously shifting the culture of the clinic toward people-centered care through participatory service design. We conclude with research directions to leverage the potential of service design for healthcare innovation, including strengthening the dialogue between explanatory and design research, exploring new multidisciplinary collaborations and integrating multiple research methods."
Multiple stakeholder market orientation: a service-dominant logic perspective of the market orientation paradigm,"Line, Nathaniel D. ;  Runyan, Rodney C. ;  Gonzalez-Padron, Tracy",Business and Management ;  Business ethics ;  Market orientation ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Stakeholders ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (1-2), p.42-60","The purpose of this research is to propose a comprehensive conceptualization of the market orientation construct that acknowledges the role of salient stakeholders in value co-creation. The proposed multiple stakeholder market orientation (MSMO) construct is a more broadly defined conceptualization of what it means to implement the marketing concept in a multi-stakeholder business environment. The construct is developed within the context of prevailing theoretical perspectives including the service-dominant logic of marketing, stakeholder theory, and the market orientation paradigm. Specifically, the construct is developed as an interconnected operant resource consisting of a stakeholder orientation, a systems orientation, and a shared value orientation."
Market-shaping: navigating multiple theoretical perspectives,"Nenonen, Suvi ;  Storbacka, Kaj",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.336-353","There is an increasing managerial and scholarly interest in the agential efforts of firms, consumers, public actors, and various collectives to influence market formation and transformation. Determining the essence of market-shaping requires an understanding of who is engaged in the shaping, what is being shaped, and how the shaping efforts are performed. To support making more informed choices about which theories to use when examining this phenomenon, we provide an overview of seven theoretical perspectives, illuminating their conceptual underpinnings and relative strengths. Building on this, we discuss how these perspectives can be used to examine market-shaping, highlighting its typical variations. The paper concludes by a call for greater explicitness, compatibility and parsimony when choosing theoretical perspectives for market-shaping research, and by identifying avenues for further research."
The intermingling of meanings in marketing: semiology and phenomenology in consumer culture theory,"Grace, Sarah C.",Business and Management ;  Culture ;  Marketing ;  Phenomenology ;  Semiotics ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.70-80","This paper explores the construction of meaning in consumer culture through a synthesis of two scholarly streams within the Consumer Culture Theory (CCT) body of knowledge: semiology and phenomenology. Semiology represents consumer culture as a web of meanings—studying cultural meanings as socially agreed-upon structures.  By contrast, phenomenology represents the interpretation and personalization of cultural meanings by consumers—focusing on meanings that emerge from individual lived experience. Combining these two approaches results in a framework that excavates meanings at both the cultural level and the individual level, inviting them into a figure-ground relationship. This relationship between levels of analysis illuminates how meaning in consumer culture is constructed, and how cultural meanings come to constitute a sense of normalcy in modern societies. As all marketing activity is culturally situated, understanding meaning in consumer culture provides an alternative way to understand value in marketing."
From customer journeys to consumption journeys: a consumer culture approach to investigating value creation in practice-embedded consumption,"Schau, Hope Jensen ;  Akaka, Melissa Archpru",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual ;  Value creation,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.9-22","Prior research on customer journeys chiefly focuses on identifying, from the firm perspective, firm-customer touchpoints. Importantly, the extant literature begins to maps aggregate firm-customer interactions over time to reveal how sequenced firm-controlled touchpoints contribute to customer experience. These customer journey maps tend to emphasize market actions, specifically purchases, over other, customer-centric touchpoints like use occasions, use experiences, storage and disposal. We extend the firm-centric
customer journey
framework to consider customer-centric touchpoints within a broader social and cultural context for value creation. We propose a consumer-centric
consumption journey
which considers consumption within progressive engagement with a practice or set of practices. We offer a culturally grounded consumption journey framework that highlights the importance of practices, communities, and institutions in value creation, and reveals various experiences and value outcomes. Future research regarding consumption journeys can advance understanding of customer experiences and journeys by investigating a variety of sociocultural influences and outcomes of value creation."
For re-institutionalizing the marketing discipline in Era V,"Hunt, Shelby D.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.189-198","Commentaries on the status of the marketing discipline conclude that it is significantly troubled, which raises the question: Do the troubles identified portend a de-institutionalization of the discipline in marketing’s Era IV (1980–2020) and its potential re-institutionalization in Era V (2020-?)? This article examines (1) the marketing discipline’s founding in Era I (1900–1920), (2) how the discipline became institutionalized in Era II (1920–1950), (3) how marketing was re-institutionalized in Era III (1950–1980), and (4) how the discipline’s fragmentation in Era IV (1980–2020) portends its de-institutionalization. The article concludes by arguing for the marketing discipline’s re-institutionalization in Era V (2020-?)."
Friendships in marketing: a taxonomy and future research directions,"Banerji, Diptiman ;  Singh, Ramendra ;  Mishra, Prashant",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.223-243","The concept of friendship remains important from societal, academic, and practitioner perspectives. We find that there is a proliferation of research in the marketing discipline on the utilization and applicability of the concept of friendship, but the literature is fragmented. By fragmentation, we refer to the fact that the notion of friendship is tapped in multiple, independent research streams. As a result, there is a lack of an organized and holistic view of friendship-related research in the marketing domain. Drawing on an extensive literature review of 130 papers in more than 30 peer-reviewed scholarly journals across a 37-years time span (1980–2017), this paper synthesizes the extant friendship research in the domain of marketing through a taxonomy, which categorizes the different types of friendship conceptualizations based on two underlying characteristics, or dimensions, the formation of friendship, and consumption timeline. The proposed taxonomy shows the differences as well as the interrelationships between the different publications, giving a systematic view of the research landscape. We suggest future research avenues as well, for further research in the area of marketing-related friendships and highlight why the research is relevant from a real-world perspective."
Resurrecting marketing,"Belk, Russell",Abductive logic ;  Algorithims ;  Analytics ;  Big data ;  Business and Management ;  Co-creation ;  Commentary ;  Disruptive innovation ;  Distributed brands ;  Imitation ;  Marketing ;  Marketing RIP ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (3-4), p.168-171","Marketing lays dying, felled by two fatal blows: 1) the shift in control of brands from marketer to consumer; and 2) the shift of many marketing functions from marketing to Big Data, algorithms, and data analytics. To resurrect marketing, we need to fundamentally refocus on marketing in a digital age."
Innovation and the theory of fields,"Fligstein, Neil",Alliances ;  Business and Management ;  Government sponsored enterprises ;  Innovations ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.272-289","Innovation does not just involve the creation of new products, but also includes the need for new kinds of processes and organizations. Field theory can help us understand why some innovations are more piecemeal and others more revolutionary. It explicitly links innovation to the process of the emergence, adjustment, and transformation of markets (conceived of as fields). To illustrate this perspective, the case of the transition in the U.S. from a mortgage market dominated by savings and loan banks to the emergence of mortgage securitization dominated by the government sponsored enterprises and the largest private banks, is explicated. Field theory helps us understand the logic of this transition and the myriad players and innovations that helped produce a large part of what we consider to be modern finance. The case also shows the limits of economic theories of financial innovation and the sociology of finance. I end with a discussion of how field theory can inform subsequent research on innovation."
Formalizing service-dominant logic as a general theory of markets: taking stock and moving forward,"Akaka, Melissa Archpru ;  Koskela-Huotari, Kaisa ;  Vargo, Stephen L.",Academic marketing ;  Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.375-389","Advancement of the marketing discipline requires a marketing-based, general theory of markets. However, most academic marketing is developed from normative theories of economics and direct application of psychological and sociological theories. Indigenous marketing theories about markets are rare but can increase the relevance of marketing scholarship. Although theories are never fully finalized, theoretical formalizing processes can establish a general framework for theory development on markets. The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual base for a general theory of markets by explicating the ongoing progression toward formalization of service-dominant (S-D) logic. We outline a recursive, cocreative process of theory formalization to take stock of the status of S-D logic’s development so far—what has been done and what we know and don’t know about markets. We propose specific areas of inquiry and research directions for moving forward in developing a general theory of markets that is indigenous to marketing."
Legendary luxury brands: inventing the future by reaching to the past,"Carpenter, Gregory S. ;  Barlier, Xavier",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.464-470","Unlike many other brands, luxury brands can enjoy remarkably enduring success. This paper presents an interview with a senior executive responsible for marketing Maison Louis Roederer’s champagnes, including the legendary Cristal, in the United States for the last 20 years. We explore the differences between luxury and mass-market brands, the role of creative vision, how brands remain relevant through innovation while remaining faithful to their history, and how luxury brands create passionate buyers who seek to be a part of the brand, not simply consumers of the brand. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for market orientation, understanding consumers as fans, and other future research topics."
The past and future of marketing theory and practice: a tribute to the 50th anniversary of the Academy of Marketing Science,"Ferrell, O.

Is sustainable marketing based on virtue ethics the answer to addressing socio-ecological challenges facing humankind?,"Prothero, Andrea ;  McDonagh, Pierre",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Ecofeminism ;  Ethics ;  Marketing ;  Marketing 4Ps ;  Marketing mix paradigm ;  Social Sciences ;  Sustainability ;  Virtue ethics,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.134-139","This commentary provides a review of Dyck and Manchanda’s work on the use of virtue ethics, through Sociological and Ecological Thought (SET) Oriented Marketing, in tackling socio-ecological challenges within society. While we concur with the focus of the paper on moving away from a central emphasis on profit maximization, we differ in how we believe this can be achieved. We critique the SET approach put forward from three key positions: (a) the SET approach and the application of virtue ethics; (b) the SET approach and the use of the marketing mix to operationalize it in practice; and, (c) the missing systemic and institutional barriers which we believe render SET problematic both theoretically and in practical terms. We conclude by suggesting that instead of utilising normative ethical theories to address socio-ecological challenges marketing researchers turn to other perspectives, such as ecofeminism."
‘Spatio-market practices’: conceptualising the always spatial dimensions of market making practices,"Holmes, Torik ;  Fernandes, Josi ;  Palo, Teea",Business and Management ;  Casino gambling ;  Conceptual ;  Market making ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Spatial theory ;  Spatio-market practices ;  Theory ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.316-335","Socio-material conceptualisations of markets suggest that they are spatial formations. Yet, the everyday practical and spatial dimensions of market making have received little explicit attention. We thus introduce the concept of spatio-market practices, drawing on key ideas in market studies and spatial theory. We argue that examining spatio-market practices (and thus the spatial dimensions of markets) promises to provide fresh insight regarding what it takes to realise markets, their uneven distribution, and what and whom markets are (and are not) designed to serve. To demonstrate what the concept calls for, supports and promises, we take Humphreys’ (
2010
) influential paper as a starting point and draw on other secondary sources in order to articulate an alternative and spatially-oriented account of the growth and legitimacy of the American casino gambling market. This paper, in turn, contributes a subtle and yet incisive shift in thinking, which supports a more explicit means of exploring markets as spatial formations."

Assessing and enhancing the impact potential of marketing articles,"Jaakkola, Elina ;  Vargo, Stephen L.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.407-415","Although the impact of marketing is a recognized priority, current academic practices do not fully support this goal. A research manuscript’s likely influence is difficult to evaluate prior to publication, and audiences differ in their understandings of what “impact” means. This article develops a set of criteria for assessing and enhancing a publication’s impact potential. An article is argued to have greater influence if it changes many stakeholders’ understandings or behaviors on a relevant matter; and makes its message accessible by offering simple and clear findings and translating them into actionable implications. These drivers are operationalized as a checklist of criteria for authors, reviewers, and research supervisors who wish to evaluate and enhance a manuscript’s potential impact. This article invites scholars to further develop and promote these criteria and to participate in establishing impact evaluation as an institutionalized practice within marketing academia."
Re-institutionalizing marketing,"Key, Thomas Martin ;  Clark, Terry ;  Ferrell, O. C. ;  Stewart, David W. ;  Pitt, Leyland",Academic marketing ;  Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Graduate studies ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.446-453","Hunt’s (AMS Rev, 10, 189–198,
2020
) notion of the re-institutionalization of marketing as a discipline provides the background for this commentary. This forward-looking context is used to address issues the marketing discipline is facing to reconcile problems we identify. Academic marketing research has become fragmented and polarized into narrow areas that do not provide holistic contributions to knowledge. Doctoral programs are focusing less on core marketing knowledge and theory and more on methodology. This brings into question the culture of both our doctoral programs and the culture of the discipline to provide high-impact research valuable to practitioners and society, as well as the firm.

Market-shaping phases—a qualitative meta-analysis and conceptual framework,"Flaig, Alexander ;  Kindström, Daniel ;  Ottosson, Mikael",Business Administration ;  Business and Management ;  Economics and Business ;  Ekonomi och näringsliv ;  Företagsekonomi ;  market creation ;  market strategy ;  market-shaping ;  Marketing ;  markets ;  Samhällsvetenskap ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.354-374","This study explores the potential existence of reoccurring patterns in market-shaping processes by employing a qualitative meta-analysis to analyze 79 case studies on market-shaping. Through the evidence-based synthesis of qualitative data, we extract 20 generalized market-shaping activities that inform and form the foundation of a three-phased market-shaping process. This conceptual framework divides the market-shaping process into the phases of infusion, formation and retention. By applying our conceptual framework to the qualitative dataset, we explore the presence of market-shaping phases and provide further insights into the interdependences and dynamics between multiple, simultaneously occurring, market-shaping processes. By providing a structured market-shaping process, we attempt to reduce the overall complexity of the market-shaping phenomenon and facilitate the operationalization of the phenomenon for further market-shaping research. Additionally, our conceptualization provides practitioners with a framework to analyze the market-shaping efforts of other market actors and support the design of their own market-shaping strategies."
Advancing marketing theory and practice: guidelines for crafting research propositions,"Ulaga, Wolfgang ;  Kleinaltenkamp, Michael ;  Kashyap, Vishal ;  Eggert, Andreas",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.395-406","Effective research propositions are key to advancing marketing theory and practice. However, our discipline provides little guidance on how to systematically craft impactful propositions. Consequently, scholars often refrain from including propositions in conceptual articles due to either a lack of knowledge or the confidence to do so. This proves detrimental to scholars looking to develop theory and conceptual papers. To address this challenge, our article defines research propositions and positions them within the broader set of the key building blocks of theory development. Based on an integrative framework that ties foundational premises, concepts, constructs, research propositions and hypothesis together, the article lays out four easy-to-follow actionable steps—grounding, crafting, connecting, and simplifying—that guide scholars in developing effective research propositions. Further, the article proposes four criteria, i.e., clarity, consistency, conciseness, and contribution to theory advancement and scholarly research, to assist scholars in evaluating outcomes achieved when writing research propositions. The article concludes by offering an agenda for how key stakeholders involved, i.e., Ph.D. students, early career researchers and established marketing scholars, university research program directors and promotion and tenure (P&T) committees, as well as reviewers and journal editors, can contribute to advancing knowledge and skills of crafting effective research propositions as part of the broader goal to stimulate the innovation and growth of marketing theories in our discipline."

This paper is a first-of-its-kind delve into what the literature is, how it is used, and its impact as a foundation for theory and conceptual work in the discipline of marketing. We create a novel approach that provides a framework to understand the way literature functions in the research process and expose the hidden mechanics of how it creates and ties together various forms of meaning through what we call, citation-based reasoning. It is through this lens that we conclude with insights for how a deeper understanding of the literature can stoke continued impact in the marketing discipline, especially for theory building and conceptual development."

Looking at the affordances of text and textuality, I consider the ways that text orients the social practices critical to market exchange through its archival and public nature."

The concept allows us to examine complex interactions between people, objects, and the dynamics of a market, and the literature based on it has illuminated the intricate tensions and contradictions within and between spheres of exchange. The use of the concept, however, is not without problems since some studies have applied dualistic or simplistic versions of it. This paper illustrates the current state of affairs by revisiting Kopytoff’s seminal work and analyzing the marketing and consumer research literature that derives from it, thus demonstrating how the conceptualization has evolved over time. In an attempt to overcome the dualist approach and further explore this topic, I propose a multidimensional perspective of spheres of exchange, offering an alternative approach for investigating the commoditization–singularization process."

Third, I use the agriculture industry to illustrate how an SSR program in marketing could be developed to bring insights to practitioners and policy makers and build new modes of production, consumption and exchange. Finally, I suggest that the SSR program facilitates collaboration between mainstream marketing and CCT researchers by providing a common ontological platform that can transform epistemological differences into complementary strengths. I argue SSR is a way that marketing research can gain broad impact and relevance."
The unconscious perception of smells as a driver of consumer responses: a framework integrating the emotion-cognition approach to scent marketing,"De Luca, Ramona ;  Botelho, Delane",Business and Management ;  Cognition & reasoning ;  Consumers ;  Marketing ;  Odors ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.145-161","Previous research demonstrates that odors affect consumers’ behavioral, cognitive, and affective responses to products and environments. Sensory and scent research have prioritized an emotional approach in which consumer responses are primarily affective reactions to smells. However, individuals’ perceptions of their environment are frequently regulated by an unconscious mechanism that does not necessarily involve rational thinking. Therefore, their responses to odors may result from automatic and unconscious cognitive processes that occur without their awareness. We propose that the unconscious odor interpretation better regulates consumers’ responses to odors and behaviors than emotions and that the way in which olfactory information is cognitively processed and integrated into knowledge may address the extent to which odors help individuals to perceive their environment holistically and attribute meanings to events and social phenomena. Through a systematic review of 55 empirical studies on olfaction, we i) discuss the current theoretical approaches to scent marketing and the most relevant empirical findings; ii) propose a cognition-based framework to investigate the underlying mechanisms through which odors are mentally processed to influence consumers’ behavioral, cognitive, and affective responses; and iii) develop a research agenda to encourage further studies on the cognitive processing of scents."
On managerial relevance: reconciling the academic-practitioner divide through market theorizing,"Wieland, Heiko ;  Nariswari, Angeline ;  Akaka, Melissa Archpru",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.252-271","The marketing academy continues to struggle with issues of managerial relevance. We argue that, at its core, marketing’s problems with managerial relevance do not lie in diverging roles and interests between academics and practitioners, but in the distinct lenses market actors apply to view and enact market realities. Building on market performativity, we assert that concepts and theories not only depict the world ‘out there,’ but also contribute to bringing about reality when enacted. Thus, the relevance of marketing academics and their work cannot simply be addressed by changing how research is conducted (e.g., more industry engagement), but more foundationally, through a shift in what is researched and how phenomena are studied. By refocusing the discussion from managerial relevance to the relevance of theoretical work in the shaping of markets, we show that both academics and practitioners need to be more cognizant of the market conceptualizations they help to perpetuate. All market actors need to broaden their understanding of markets to incorporate stable as well as dynamic and systemic depictions of markets. Market actors, paradoxically, need to become more theoretical to be more relevant in the shaping of markets."
The instantaneous commitment effect: developing stakeholder orientation among managers,"Vaid, Shashank ;  Ahearne, Michael",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.162-179","The authors introduce and investigate incoming managers’ instantaneous commitment - a novel concept increasingly relevant to frontline managers. Instantaneous commitment is a type of organizational commitment that can be formed expediently on the back of incoming managers’ preexisting role/work-related factors (stakeholder connections, relationships, and skills) offering organizations guidance on managers’ stakeholder orientation. Moreover, instantaneous commitment helps organizations avoid the classic loyalty-utility dilemma, as it provides an organization-wide instantaneous approach towards better stakeholder focus while being agnostic to emotional investment (loyalty) and to calculative assessment (utility) that may take shape over time. The authors provide a parsimonious explanation of instantaneous commitment construct and differentiate it from related constructs (affective commitment and continuance commitment). We also offer an understanding of how organizations can engender instantaneous commitment among managers. Finally, we develop a conceptual framework of a set of factors - prior role/work related antecedents, stakeholder orientation consequence of instantaneous commitment, and moderating influences of individual, environmental and new role/work related factors."
"Addressing socio-ecological issues in marketing: environmental, social and governance (ESG)","Ferrell, O. C.",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (1-2), p.140-144","This commentary addresses the Social and Ecological Thought (SET) framework based on virtue ethics (Dyck & Manchanda, in

). The basis of this framework is to replace utilitarian values that focus on profit maximization. The Financial Bottom Line (FBL) is believed to be a mainstream utilitarian philosophy. In addition, the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) is considered inadequate to address socio-ecological issues because there is a major focus on financial performance. After addressing some of the limitations in the SET framework, the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework is presented as a more relevant alternative. ESG provides a lens for creating priorities for socio-ecological comparative performance based on industry, investors’ and peer index scores. There is a strong correlation between ESG performance and profits. Compelling evidence is provided that suggests there is no conflict between socio-ecological responsibility and financial success."
Markets and institutional fields: foundational concepts and a research agenda,"Mountford, Nicola ;  Geiger, Susi",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2021, Vol.11 (3-4), p.290-303","We borrow the notion of field from institutional theory to think through how markets and their ‘outsides’–or at least one particular manifestation of an ‘outside’–stand in a dynamic and interactive relationship. We distinguish the field and the market in terms of issues versus exchange and identity versus position. We argue that the lack of clarity as to how fields and markets differ, relate, overlap, and are bounded, jeopardizes our ability to address important societal debates concerning the roles of markets within and across other areas of social life. It also hinders a consolidation of insights across different approaches to studying markets, even though researchers from different disciplines often address similar concerns. Key questions for which both conceptual and analytical clarity are essential include how markets and their ‘outsides’ (here: fields) intersect; whether and how diverse sets of actors interact, work, and migrate between fields and markets; and what dynamics may be observable between field and market. We provide four illustrative examples of field/market relationships and a theoretical, methodological, and empirical research agenda for future research into markets and their ‘outsides’."

The socio-material lens has done much to explain how specific assemblages circulate information and goods, but has done little to explain how different infrastructures configure relations between dispersed market practices. Using the history of
the development of the market for market research
we show how
knowledge-based infrastructures
constitute markets as knowledge objects: new expertise emerged through alliances between academia, government, and private actors form a new occupation embodied in specialist agencies that set themselves up in an infrastructural relation to marketing practices. Our conceptualization of markets as knowledge objects extends extant understandings of markets by showing how: (1) extant knowledge-based infrastructures are drawn on to construct new markets; (2) infrastructural relations emerge between different markets to constitute multiple systems of provision and demand, leading to an increasingly valuable knowledge infrastructure; and (3) organized practices in one market are often heavily reliant on connections to other markets, including knowledge-based infrastructures such as market research services."
"How valence, volume and variance of online reviews influence brand attitudes","Zablocki, Agnieszka ;  Schlegelmilch, Bodo ;  Houston, Michael J.",Attitudes ;  Brand loyalty ;  Business and Management ;  Digital marketing ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (1-2), p.61-77","Online reviews can strongly influence purchase decisions. In the past decade, extensive research in the field of online reviews has focused on product categories (e.g., hedonic, utilitarian) and product sales. However, research on how the characteristics of online reviews (valence, volume, and variance) influence attitudes toward brands is sparse, even though brands are among the most valuable corporate assets and companies use online marketing extensively to increase brand loyalty. Thus, this paper offers a conceptual model that closely examines the relationship between the characteristics of online reviews and brand attitudes. The model contributes to a better understanding of the influence of contextual factors on brand attitudes within online communication. In line with prior research, the study conceptualizes volume and variance as moderators of valence. Furthermore, the proposed conceptual model integrates brand type (functional, emotional, symbolic, and lifestyle) and the source of review (stranger or acquaintance) as potential moderators. Conceptual insights, along with managerial implications for online marketing managers, are provided."

As a result, a great deal of attention is paid to mechanisms that foster viral spread. However, due to the consumer-influenced nature of viral replication, it is also important to consider the malleability of such messages. Expanding the focus to include the potential for viral mutations is a critical step in understanding how viral messages evolve and in understanding which messages are most likely to spread and generate their desired impact. Further, there currently is no accepted model for the viral marketing replication process to guide research efforts. Therefore, this article defines viral message mutations, builds a framework for the viral replication process, and identifies susceptibility to mutation at various stages of that process. The proposed framework is then used to offer numerous avenues for future research."

Brand-self connections and brand prominence as drivers of employee brand attachment,"Gill-Simmen, Lucy ;  MacInnis, Deborah J. ;  Eisingerich, Andreas B. ;  Whan Park, C.",Brand loyalty ;  Business and Management ;  Employees ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (3-4), p.128-146","Past research reveals that customers can attach meanings to brands that create strong connections between the brand and the self. When they do, and when the brand is prominent in their minds, they become psychologically attached to the brand, and display strong brand loyalty and advocacy behaviors. We use a grounded theory framework to ask if
employees
develop similar brand-self connections and regard the brand as prominent in their lives based on the meaning they attach to the brand they work for. This question is important because employee’s attachment to the brand can have critical equity-driving implications for the brand’s marketplace success and the employee’s commitment to the organization. We also ask what drives such outcomes. Beyond identifying novel drivers of employees’ brand attachment, we find that employees’ attachment to a brand is conceptually and empirically different from attachment or commitment to the organization. Specifically, we observe employees who are not attached to the organization but who are still attached to the brand, and who engage in difficult-to-enact pro-brand and pro-organization behaviors. Finally, our findings contribute to a broader knowledge base on organizational commitment and attachment by identifying brand meaning-related drivers of employees’ organizational commitment/attachment. Prior research has studied non-brand related drivers of these organizational outcomes."

This article proposes a parsimonious organizing framework for marketing strategy decisions and the tools associated with each decision. This framework is grounded in four assumptions or first principles that guide the effectiveness of any marketing strategy: (1) All customers differ, (2) all customers change, (3) all competitors react, and (4) all resources are limited. By reviewing prior marketing research through the lens of these four principles, this article illustrates how marketing theory and practice can apply extant analyses and frameworks to support strategy decisions associated with each principle. The authors also theorize about how the four principles build on one another in a natural sequence to guide the formation and execution of marketing strategies."

Therefore, it is imperative that doctoral programs place theory at the heart of curriculum that shapes the thinking, priorities, and research efforts of our new scholars. Unfortunately, in many doctoral programs, this does not happen. To spur a conversation on this critically important issue in our discipline, I suggest five initiatives that seek to reimagine the content and structure of marketing doctoral programs. These initiatives are: (1) Add marketing to marketing doctoral programs; (2) Create a dedicated space in the curriculum for theory construction; (3) Restructure the sequence of doctoral seminars; (4) Make a foundational essay mandatory in dissertations; and (5) Change the culture of marketing doctoral programs."

However, a review of marketing literature shows that this field lacks conceptual and theoretical clarity. This article reviews research published on sustainability from 25 leading marketing journals between 1997 and 2016. It examines how theories used to frame sustainability in marketing literature have evolved. Additionally, no unified definition for sustainability exists in current marketing literature. To fill this void, the author proposes a new, holistic definition of sustainability in marketing, coined “sustainable marketing,” which is unique to the marketing discipline. Through presenting the GREEN Framework of Sustainable Marketing, the author conceptually and theoretically clarifies, unifies, and extends the current research. Finally, the systematic review explores implications for theory and practice and offers researchers, practitioners, and policymakers many opportunities for future research."

However, ambiguities in that paradigm have hindered development of a general theory of marketing. This research takes a fresh look at these concepts that some academics regard as causing an identity crisis in marketing. Historical analysis reveals many practical applications, which arise from the broadening/generic paradigm, result in unresolvable theoretical anomalies. Consequently, a new paradigm is proposed. Marketing systems, we argue, provides a logically coherent foundation for building a general theory of marketing."

"The contingent value of pay inequalities in sales organizations: integrating literatures in economics, management, and psychology","Rouziou, Maria",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Salespeople ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (3-4), p.184-204","Pay-for-performance compensation systems are often employed in sales organizations and can potentially lead to pay inequalities. With increased transparency of employees’ pay outcomes stemming from CRM and related technologies, salespeople now have ample opportunity to observe these inequalities, compare their pay with that of others, and make fairness assessments. These comparisons and assessments then have implications in terms of utility, behaviors, and performance of salespeople, which have scarcely been explored in the sales or marketing literature. This article considers research on pay inequality from three other fields – economics, management, and psychology – and highlights relevant issues in sales contexts. Furthermore, the article provides scholars with a resource that elaborates on the nature of pay inequalities and their multiple outcomes on individual and organizational performance, as well as noting their likely antecedents and moderators."

We discuss and compare food sharing exchange systems in India and the US. We focus on the antecedents and drivers of food sharing exchange systems, the processes by which institutional actors influence food sharing exchange systems and the underlying reasons due to which food-sharing systems emerge. Our work substantively builds on the extant literature on the theory of exchange and institutional theory in marketing. We develop a compelling exchange narrative of how institutional actors can drive consumer welfare across diverse exchange systems."

Such offerings have upended business processes by being less costly for firms to produce, store, and distribute. The ways in which consumers access them and interact with them have called into question traditional notions of ownership, access and control. This paper extends the thinking about digital offerings by proposing a Digital Continuum framework: a conceptual model anchored at one end by Digital Products and at the other by Digital Services. We discuss the benefits and costs that accrue to both consumers and firms along the Continuum that result from differences in ownership, access, control and customization/cocreation."
Effective reviewing for conceptual journal submissions,"Griffin, Abbie ;  Barczak, Gloria",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Quality ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2020, Vol.10 (1-2), p.36-48","Peer reviewed academic journals, like
AMS
Review, live and die by their ability to obtain high quality reviews of submitted manuscripts. However, academics are increasingly pressed for time, needing to publish their research, teach their classes, and provide service to their Department, Faculty/College and University to support their careers in terms of retention, tenure, and promotion. Amidst these responsibilities, as a service to the Academy, academics also are expected to provide reviews of manuscripts in order to move the intellectual trajectory of the domain forward. High quality reviewing, though, takes cognitive energy and is time consuming, which then interferes with other academic responsibilities. For these reasons, editors of peer-reviewed academic journals are finding it more and more difficult to obtain a sufficient number of high-quality reviews to make good decisions about submissions in a timely manner. The purpose of this article is to help
all
reviewers, but especially those reviewing conceptual articles, provide a high-quality review. Specifically, this article first defines what constitutes a “high quality review,” and suggests how reviewing can aid an academic’s own research, writing and career. It then defines the behaviors needed for effective reviewing for all manuscripts, termed the 5 R’s: roles, responsibilities, responses, reactions, and respect. It then provides a reviewing template for conceptual articles, given the special difficulties of peer reviewing such articles, and closes with a few additional pieces of advice to help with being efficient in reviewing, while being effective."

The promise of shared decision making in healthcare,"Steffensen, Karina Dahl",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Decision making ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (1-2), p.105-109","The number of people with chronic or long-term physical and mental illnesses has increased and will continue to do so. Many must learn to live with one or more diseases throughout their lives. Healthcare service must therefore support, to a greater extent, individuals living with illness. An important part of this transition is to improve the use of patients’ knowledge and resources to organize treatment in accordance with their own needs and values. Patient-centered healthcare can provide better patient experiences, better professional quality, and the possibility of slowing down resource consumption. Therefore, patient-centered initiatives have taken center stage in discussions on how to improve quality in healthcare service as discussed by Berry (2019) in this issue of the AMS Review. A cornerstone of patient-centered care is shared decision making, where healthcare professionals and patients work together to reach a shared healthcare choice."

Objective time is straightforward, and refers to clock time. In contrast, subjective time is quite nuanced and refers to the differential experience and perception of time. Recognizing this distinction, a number of scholars have suggested that the marketing discipline relies upon objective time, and as a result, does not have a fully developed understanding of time. Conducting a historical assessment of time, we demonstrate that marketing has a conceptually-bounded view of time. We develop a conceptual framework that reconceptualizes time as objective and subjective and as experienced by multiple referents, and develop research propositions that highlight the importance of integrating a broadened view of time into marketing research, recognizing that we are better off thinking about time as objective time and subjective time. We conclude with a discussion highlighting future research opportunities."

Building on a multidisciplinary approach and a review of power models, we begin with a conceptualization of empowerment, identifying the concept’s contours and origins. Then, we show how multidisciplinary advancements influence the marketing discipline through an assessment of the empowerment literature. We reveal important knowledge gaps on the topic related to different theoretical orientations and various levels of analysis and context. We then propose an organizing framework to help understand the underlying mechanisms induced in psychological empowerment by changes in the market structure and technological shifts, consumer-to-firm, state-to-consumer, and firm-to-consumer deliberate actions. Our critical review of the marketing literature reveals the limits of prior research, and we suggest directions for future theoretical and empirical research on the consumer empowerment theme."

"For service innovation in end-of-life care, branding and messaging matter","Stuart, Brad",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Innovations ;  Marketing ;  Older people ;  Palliative care ;  Patient care planning ;  Patients ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (1-2), p.110-114","Many patients over 65 with advanced chronic illness undergo medical treatment that fails to align with their preferences as the end of life approaches. In particular, unwanted hospitalizations increase in number and duration, a pattern of overtreatment that not only violates patient choice but also constitutes preventable medical waste. Existing services that align care with patient preference are underused, in part because both physicians and patients associate them with dying and denial of treatment. An innovative program developed at Sutter Health, a large integrated system in Northern California, illustrates how to remedy this situation. Nurse-led teams bring care to the residences of more than 2000 patients with advanced illness each day, increasing the quality of their care, reducing hospitalizations and lowering costs. Program branding and messaging has led to widespread acceptance, and the initiative has become a foundational component of a new Medicare payment model. Skillful branding and messaging of service innovation initiatives can help to overcome the emotional and attitudinal barriers restricting the use of current service lines, changing the focus of care for seriously-ill people from the hospital to their homes."

And while all embody theoretical advancements in marketing describing situations where firms and customers collaborate in the co-creation of value, heretofore they have received limited exploration in fundamental models of pricing. Seeking to fill this gap, we delve into the co-creation literature in search of conceptual building blocks. From a detailed review, we identify six distinct mechanisms underlying value created by customers but absent from existing pricing models. In the course of their co-creative interactions with firms, customers can provide knowledge, innovation, attention, effort, quality and additional revenue to firms. We proceed to construct a model of price determination which incorporates elements of co-creative value from customers and elaborate real world applications of the model. The conceptual and practical implications of incorporating co-creation into pricing are far-reaching and we offer directions for both audiences."

A key catalyst for innovation—acknowledged by managers as well as academics—is input from customers. However, the functional aspect of customer input in the process of business model innovation (BMI) is still ambiguous. In this paper, we explore the role of customers in the process of BMI and propose a conceptual model that links customer input to BMI success. Particularly, our model demonstrates how customer input is generated and how organizations can efficiently and effectively manage such input to enhance the performance of their newly innovated BM. This proposed model provides managers with a basis for developing actionable plans to reach customers, utilize their input during the BMI process, and enhance BMI success."

These methods can provide researchers with tools to understand and predict marketing outcomes that emerge at the aggregate level by modeling feedback between heterogeneous agents and agent interaction with various marketing environmental variables. While the benefits of complex systems approaches often come with a high computational cost, steady advances in access to better computational resources has allowed more researchers to adopt complex systems approaches as part of their portfolio of methods. In this paper, we will provide a description of the key concepts, benefits, and tools of complex systems. The goal of this work is to encourage marketing researchers and practitioners who are not familiar with these approaches to consider the adoption of these methods.

Toward an improved conceptual understanding of consumer ambivalence,"Sipilä, Jenni ;  Tarkiainen, Anssi ;  Sundqvist, Sanna",Business and Management ;  Consumption ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (3-4), p.147-162","Despite the significance of ambivalence in consumer research, the concept suffers from a lack of clarity. This study thus aims to develop an improved conceptual understanding of consumer ambivalence based on the analysis of existing definitions. A number of challenges are observed and addressed through key premises that characterize the concept of consumer ambivalence. Furthermore, the presented conceptualization is contextualized into the area of consumption. The result of this process is an enhanced view of consumer ambivalence that builds on and extends earlier conceptualizations in 1) recognizing a wide variety of concepts that can be studied under the umbrella of consumer ambivalence, 2) specifying the multitude of objects of consumer ambivalence, and 3) specifying the temporal scope of consumer ambivalence through the concept of consumption episodes. The proposed conceptualization accommodates the richness of different approaches to consumer ambivalence and thus contributes to a wide range of consumer research."

Managers use the term “Big Data” to describe this avalanche of information, which many view as critical to providing a better understanding of customers and markets. This research uses interviews with managers to examine the marketing function’s perspective on data-driven decision making within the firm. Based on informant responses, we develop a hierarchy of data-oriented decision making, describe the drivers that influence where a firm falls within this hierarchy, and detail several transition capabilities for marketing managers interested in becoming more data-driven. The key factors that influence the level of data driven decision making are: 1) firm environment; 2), competition, 3) executive commitment, 4) interdepartmental dynamics, and 5) organizational structure. This framework guides marketing managers both in evaluating the firm’s data capabilities and facilitating change."

Previous research has examined the roles of loss sensitivity, strategic responding, differences between buyers and sellers in information processing, self-enhancement, and psychological ownership as causes of the endowment effect. This article presents a conceptual perspective based on the theory of the extended self that integrates previously proposed mechanisms for the endowment effect. The self-extension perspective generates novel predictions about possible moderators of the endowment effect. Further, the self-extension perspective also raises questions for product valuation in general. By integrating previous research and posing new questions, the self-extension perspective provides a new base for the advancement of research on product valuation."

This is due to the experiential nature of service and subtle qualities of engaging customer interactions. Yet, organizations face significant challenges while leveraging the knowledge of their FLEs to develop service innovations. Drawing upon the open innovation and social network literatures, we theorize the role of FLE networks, and the degree to which these networks enable the flow of distinct content for realizing effective service innovation. Specifically, we conceptualize a taxonomy of network
domains
—connecting customer- and internal-facing employees, and resource
flows
—new knowledge and self-governance activities, to provide a framework for FLE roles in knowledge networks for service-innovation. Our taxonomy expands opportunities for theorizing the mechanisms of frontline knowledge networks in service innovation as well as identifying a “dark side” that undermines potential innovation gains if left unchecked. Future directions and implications for theory and practice are discussed."
Global new product development: moderating role of national culture on the link between buyer–seller interactions and innovation outcomes,"Sivakumar, K. ;  Roy, Subroto",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Product development ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2019, Vol.9 (3-4), p.205-229","The emergence of varying perspectives on globalization has meant that buyer-seller interactions in the context of new product development (NPD) are becoming culturally more nuanced. Important research findings exist on the factors influencing the various stages of the NPD process, the role of buyer-seller interactions on NPD, and the role of national culture on NPD. What happens when global NPD occurs between buyers and sellers in different cultures? Does the type of interaction and the stage of NPD matter? How can buyers leverage NPD success globally using the dimensions of national culture? Extant research does not offer a conceptual framework to examine the moderating role of national culture differences on the link between buyer-seller interactions and different stages of NPD. Such a framework is important to expand our knowledge of the NPD process in the increasingly global environment and to offer meaningful guidance to executives when managing the NPD process cross culturally. Our research sheds light on these important questions at the intersection of NPD, national culture, and buyer-seller interactions. In doing so, we differentiate between the initiation and implementation stages of NPD and distinguish between variety and intensity of interactions. We then consider the moderating role of six national cultural dimensions (individualism, power distance, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and indulgence). Important implications of our work for research and managerial practice are highlighted."
Market orientation − firm performance link in a dynamic environment: looking inside the black box,"Sett, Rahul Kumar",Business and Management ;  Market orientation ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (3-4), p.163-179","Our understanding of how market orientation can sustain superior firm performance in a rapidly changing environment is still evolving. This paper presents a model that explains the phenomenon by viewing market orientation as a firm-level dynamic capability that comprises three component capacities: to
sense
opportunities and threats; to
seize
opportunities and/or guard against threats; and to
reconfigure
firm resources in sync with environmental changes. These three capacities represent the three dimensions of market orientation. The nature of these capacities and the organizational processes that undergird them are explicated. It is argued that the capacities of sensing, seizing, and resource reconfiguration can help a market oriented firm to advantageously exploit environmental uncertainties and thereby sustain superior performance. Direction of future research and managerial implications are discussed."

Firm authenticity is distinguished from trustworthiness, corporate social responsibility, and market orientation, providing insight into the strategy’s theoretical boundaries. Drawing on signaling and stakeholder theories, a mediated conceptual model capturing a series of research propositions is advanced. Signaling theory suggests that signaling authenticity can be effective, and stakeholder theory proposes that firm authenticity appeals to all stakeholders, resulting in increased shareholder value and potentially shielding the firm from negative consumer reactions, whereas signaling theory proposes that it positively influences consumer related outcome variables (loyalty and purchase intentions). Managers are encouraged to integrate authenticity into their organizations, while research extensions that operationalize the construct and test its nomological validity, using latent variable modeling, secondary data analysis, or a combination thereof are recommended."

Hence, metaphors can satisfy important requirements of marketing communications. Accordingly, in recent decades, an increasing amount of marketing research has examined this concept. The present article provides an overview of this research on metaphors in the advertising literature, outlines the importance of metaphoric advertising for achieving key marketing aims, and identifies crucial research gaps in the current literature. Based on this overview, we integrate theoretical ideas and empirical findings from marketing and (consumer) psychology to develop the Metaphoric Advertising Processing Model (MAP), which offers new insights into the definition, processing, comprehension, and outcomes of metaphoric advertising. We conclude with concrete suggestions and recommendations for future research and describe the practical implications of the model."
Why broadened marketing has enriched marketing,"Kotler, Philip",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Marketing ;  Nonprofit organizations ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (1-2), p.20-22","The marketing discipline, which emerged in the early 1900s, spent its first 70 years focused on describing and evaluating how for-profit organizations conduct their commercial operations with products and services. Starting in the 1970s, marketing scholars – Philip Kotler, Sidney Levy, Gerald Zaltman, and Richard Bagozzi – wrote a series of articles showing that marketing activities go on in the non-profit sector as well. They proposed that the marketing discipline would be enriched by working with the “marketing” problems of non-profit and public organizations--not just the marketing problems of commercial organizations. This subsequently came to be known as the “broadening of marketing.” A few years later, some marketers challenged the broadening idea as not belonging in the discipline of marketing. The broadening scholars suggested carrying out a referendum with marketing professors. The subsequent vote proved to be overwhelmingly in favor of the broadening movement. More recently, Adel El-Ansary and co-authors (El-Ansary et al.

) raised the question of whether the broadening work is part of a larger paradigm that might lead to a general theory of marketing."
"Proposal, project, practice, pause: Developing a framework for evaluating smart domestic product engagement","Woodall, Tony ;  Rosborough, Julie ;  Harvey, John",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (1-2), p.58-74","Smart homes are fast becoming a reality, with smart TVs, smart meters and other such “smart” devices/systems already representing a substantial household presence. These, which we collectively term “smart domestic products” (SDPs), will need to be promoted, adopted, and normalized into daily routines. Despite this, the marketing canon lacks a substantive discourse on pertinent research. We look to help correct this by melding ideas from organizational sociology, innovation diffusion and appropriation studies, and service dominant logic. Consequently, we suggest a framework for research that responds directly to the specific characteristics of SDPs. Using the SDP eco-system as a context, our framework emphasizes the interplay of embeddedness, practice, value and engagement. It comprises a four-stage horizontal/longitudinal axis we describe as proposal, project, practice and pause. Cross-sectionally we focus on value, and combine aspects of existing thought to suggest how this impacts each stage of our engagement continuum. We subsequently identify perceived personal advantage as the resultant of these two axes and propose this as the key for understanding consumer and SDP sociomaterial engagement. This article also advances a definition of SDPs and ends with an agenda for further research."

This research shortfall is unfortunate given the increasing focus of savvy retail managers on brand building and the creation of sustainable competitive advantage through exterior store architecture, outdoor lifestyle centers, and urban shopping districts. In order to stimulate research in this important, yet under-researched topic area, we synthesize literature from a number of domains and provide a conceptual framework that examines the impact of outdoor atmospherics on shoppers’ psychological and behavioral responses. After presentation of this framework, we discuss implications for practice and potential avenues for future research."

This framework distinguishes four ideal-typical models of the relationship marketing process: (1) life-cycle, (2) evolutionary, (3) teleological and (4) dialectical process models. Our review of the relationship marketing literature reveals the prevalence of life-cycle conceptions of the relationship marketing process, followed by teleological and evolutionary conceptions. It is against this backdrop that we illustrate the value of dialectical process models as a first promising opportunity to advance relationship marketing theory. The second opportunity we showcase consists in combining two (or more) of these process models. We end with guidelines on how to identify suitable combinations of commensurable process models to systematize the multifaceted opportunities for advancing theory in relationship marketing and beyond."
Three systems underpinning marketing behavior,"Bagozzi, Richard P.",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (1-2), p.23-29","The new marketing systems paradigm proposed by El-Ansary, Shaw, and Lazer in their thoughtful AMS Review Article is taken to heart herein by reframing disparate pieces of scholarship and emerging research in the field through a systems lens. Three systems are proposed to undergird marketing theories, thought, and behavior: (1) a purposive-driven, goal-directed behavior systems point of view that the actors contemplating, entering, engaging, and resolving marketing exchanges undergo, (2) biological systems (neuroscience, endocrinological, and genetic) grounding marketing exchanges, and (3) cooperative and competitive systems in which goal-directed behavior and biological systems are realized in an integrative way. It is straining, however, to characterize the state of the field as constituting an identity crisis in my opinion, because the majority of marketing scholars, practitioners, and students do not appear to be concerned with or even aware of such a crisis in that the history of marketing thought does not interest them. Perhaps once the field moves from descriptive frameworks to testable theories, and experiences an integration of ideas potentially building towards more comprehensive theories in marketing, we will see hope for a general theory of marketing."

Constructing a theoretical framework for the process of innovation legitimation,"Thyroff, Anastasia ;  Siemens, Jennifer Christie ;  Murray, Jeff B.",Business and Management ;  Marketing ;  Nanotechnology ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (3-4), p.180-194","The purpose of this research is to provide a framework for studying the key stakeholders who play a role in the process legitimation of an innovation. Specifically, we combine Foucault’s discourse on power, Latour’s Actor Network Theory and Goffman’s frame analysis to present a theoretical framework for the process of innovation legitimation (PIL). To demonstrate its usefulness, we apply the PIL framework to the context of nanotechnology. We ultimately determine that there are four key stakeholders trying to frame nanotechnology: 1) Advancement (i.e., government), 2) Management (i.e., industry), 3) Development (i.e., academia), and 4) Reflection (i.e., NGOs). The trajectory of market formation and legitimation for nanotechnology will depend largely on the cultural discourses that are disseminated by these four actors and the way other peripheral actors interpret the dominant frames. By conceptualizing the current frames for an innovation in the process of legitimizing, the future of each key discourse can be envisioned."
Marketing’s identity crisis: it’s complicated,"Ferrell, O. C.",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (1-2), p.30-38","El-Ansary et al. (

, 2017) provide a 100-year historical review of the concepts and paradigms that have led to an identity crisis in marketing. This commentary is a retrospective review, contributing to the understanding of the evolution of concepts and changes in the marketing discipline which have precipitated this identity crisis. In addition, progress in the development of marketing theory is examined to determine if there are major theories or frameworks that can assist in resolving the identity crisis. Concerns about the current narrow focus on consumer behavior, modeling, and methodological sophistication have resulted from the failure of the marketing discipline to determine appropriate research agenda and topics important in marketing education. A marketing systems paradigm is considered for resolving this identity crisis in academia and industry."
A marketing identity is flourishing,"Levy, Sidney J.",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (1-2), p.18-19","This commentary reports my view of the paper by El-Ansary, Shaw, and Lazer (
2018
). I take issue with two main aspects of the paper: (1) I doubt that there is a crisis in the identity of the marketing field, and (2) I doubt that paradigm four, which they propose, will supplant the current ruling paradigm. I explain these disagreements by giving my version of the historical developments and by describing the current situation that I believe will survive their contribution and claims."
Consumer empowerment in consumer–firm relationships: conceptual framework and implications for research,"Akhavannasab, Sanam ;  Dantas, Danilo C. ;  Senecal, Sylvain",Business and Management ;  Consumers ;  Empowerment ;  Marketing ;  Perceptions ;  Power ;  Social Sciences ;  Theory/Conceptual,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (3-4), p.214-227","This article contributes to the literature on consumer power in consumer-firm relationships in three ways. First, it proposes a consumer empowerment framework adopting a consumer perspective that includes the antecedents and consequences of consumer power perception. Second, it distinguishes two manifestations of consumer power perception: personal power—the perceived ability to resist or ignore a firm’s persuasive efforts and make final decisions independently—and social power—the perception of influencing a firm’s decisions and responses. Third, it identifies the entities involved (i.e., firms, third parties, and other consumers) that empower consumers through the exchange of resources. Moreover, this article discusses how the constructs of consumer power and empowerment differ from related concepts such as perceived control and self-efficacy. Finally, it proposes a research agenda."
The transition from products to connected health: observations and avenues for future research,"Pitt, Leyland ;  Lord Ferguson, Sarah ;  Berthon, Pierre",Business and Management ;  Commentary ;  Corporate culture ;  Marketing ;  Social Sciences ;  Strategic management,"AMS review, 2018, Vol.8 (3-4), p.233-239","The transition of ResMed, the world’s leading manufacturer of therapies and devices for Obstructive Sleep Apnea, from a goods producer to an information-intensive firm presents a compelling opportunity for marketing scholars to revisit fundamental issues in strategic marketing’s theoretical past. These issues are still vitally relevant today and spark a host of interesting and important research opportunities for marketing scholars to pursue. In this commentary, we identify three important transformations undertaken by ResMed’s strategic leadership, which have strong ties to classical marketing theories and scholarship. First, ResMed moves from being a goods manufacturer to an information-intensive firm. This raises questions about the value of information that should intrigue marketing researchers. Second, the firm redefines its business, and does this not just once, but as is apparent from the case, on a dynamic basis. There are many avenues for marketing scholars of today to return to and explore in this regard. Third, ResMed makes substantial shifts in organizational culture, and also changes its structure as the result of its transformed strategy. While culture has been reasonably well considered in the marketing literature, the strategy-structure debate has mostly been conceded to strategic management scholars. There are still very fruitful research issues for marketing academics to explore in this regard."
